<p>Introduction:.</p>
<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p>In  barbaric  worlds  of  fantasy  and  far-flung </p>
<p>galaxies,  great  heroes  battle  for  gold,  glory, </p>
<p>justice, or mere survival. Some wear mithril armor </p>
<p>and wield massive swords glowing with magical </p>
<p>energy.  Others  are  commandos  in  the  latest </p>
<p>ballistic vests spraying lead from their submachine </p>
<p>guns. Some aren’t even human.</p>
<p>But  they  are  all  heroes,  and  their  epic  tales </p>
<p>inspire those who read them. This game system </p>
<p>attempts  to  simulate  these  incredible  tales—at </p>
<p>least in our imaginations—giving form, structure, </p>
<p>and  challenge  to  the  heroes  and  the  savage </p>
<p>worlds they walk in with rules that are simple on </p>
<p>the surface and comprehensive in their depth.</p>
<p>The  game  focuses  on  the  action  rather  than </p>
<p>statistics  and  bookkeeping,  allowing  the  Game </p>
<p>Master to concentrate on the player characters, </p>
<p>their foes, and the fantastic settings they battle in.</p>
<p>For players, <i>Savage Worlds</i> has an extremely </p>
<p>rich  advancement  system  that  lets  you  create </p>
<p>everything  from  a  swashbuckling  rogue  to  a </p>
<p>charismatic investigative reporter.</p>
<p>Some “generic” rules systems come up lacking </p>
<p>in  certain  settings. <i> Savage  Worlds</i>  avoids  this </p>
<p>with Setting Rules (you’ll find a list of common </p>
<p>Setting  Rules  on  page  108). These  allow  the </p>
<p>Game Master to fundamentally alter the feel of </p>
<p>the game without changing the basic mechanics. </p>
<p>Players can explore haunted space hulks in power </p>
<p>armor, battle dragons, or surf the matrix of a virtual </p>
<p>computer world without having to learn all-new </p>
<p>rules. But throw in something like Righteous Rage </p>
<p>from Solomon Kane®—which makes a hero far </p>
<p>more deadly in his most desperate moments—and </p>
<p>the entire feel of the game changes in an instant.</p>
<p>What’s.New?</p>
<p>This deluxe version of the <i>Savage Worlds</i> rules </p>
<p>system is the culmination of a decade’s play with </p>
<p>suggestions  and  comments  gathered  from  our </p>
<p>own campaigns and the thousands of adventures </p>
<p>we’ve run at game stores and conventions across </p>
<p>the  globe.  For  those  who  have  already  played </p>
<p>we think you’ll find this the most complete and </p>
<p>comprehensive  edition  of  the  rules  we’ve  ever </p>
<p>published.  We’ve  compiled  the  best  material </p>
<p>from our setting books and added in web updates </p>
<p>like  gritty  damage  rules  and  interludes.  Races </p>
<p>and vehicles are back from the first edition, as </p>
<p>well as the race creation rules from the Fantasy </p>
<p>Companion and a consolidated list of all the best </p>
<p>powers from our many expansions.</p>
<p>Veterans of our game will also find a number </p>
<p>of Design Notes scattered throughout the book. </p>
<p>These are insights into why a particular rule is </p>
<p>written the way it is and the thinking that went </p>
<p>into it.</p>
<p>For  those  who  are  new,  we  welcome  you  to </p>
<p>the  “Savages,”  and  encourage  you  to  join  one </p>
<p>of  the  most  friendly,  helpful,  and  enthusiastic </p>
<p>communities in gaming on our forums and mailing </p>
<p>lists.</p>
<p>And if you already own Savage Worlds and want </p>
<p>a list of all the changes or additions we’ve made </p>
<p>here <b>completely free, </b>just go to our website at </p>
<p>www.peginc.com!</p>
<p>Now let your imagination wander to worlds of </p>
<p>danger and adventure, where heroes are larger </p>
<p>than life and monsters stalk the land. These are </p>
<p>savage  worlds—and  those  who  survive  them </p>
<p>become legends...</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--5</p>
<p>Getting.Started</p>
<p>You’ll need a few other items besides this book </p>
<p>to begin your journey:</p>
<p>Dice</p>
<p><i>Savage  Worlds</i>  uses  traditional  gaming  dice: </p>
<p>4-sided,  6-sided,  8-sided,  10-sided,  12-sided, </p>
<p>and some settings use a 20-sided die as well. As </p>
<p>a player, you’ll also want a “Wild Die,” a d6 of a </p>
<p>different color which we’ll explain in Chapter One. </p>
<p>Dice are available from your favorite local gaming </p>
<p>store, or online directly from Pinnacle.</p>
<p>We abbreviate the different dice as d4, d6, d8, </p>
<p>d10,  d12,  and  d20.  If  you  see  something  like </p>
<p>2d6+1, that means to roll two six-sided dice, add </p>
<p>the two together, then add 1 to the total.</p>
<p>Players need only one set of dice. The Game </p>
<p>Master might want a couple of sets so she can </p>
<p>roll attacks for several villains at once.</p>
<p>The.Action.Deck</p>
<p><i>Savage Worlds</i> uses a standard deck of playing </p>
<p>cards with the Jokers left in. Cards are used for </p>
<p>initiative in combat and to help keep things moving </p>
<p>fast and furious. You’ll even find an official set of </p>
<p><i>Savage Worlds </i>cards where you found this book!</p>
<p>A.Setting</p>
<p>Will  you  and  your  friends  explore  post-</p>
<p>apocalyptic  ruins<i>?</i>  Lead  a  rugged  warband  in </p>
<p>your favorite fantasy world? Take on the role of </p>
<p>vampire lords? Or perhaps fight evil in the many </p>
<p>theaters of <i>Weird Wars?</i></p>
<p>Pick up the book for your favorite game setting </p>
<p>at  your  local  game  store,  or  create  your  own. </p>
<p>Official Savage Settings<b> </b>include new Edges and </p>
<p>Hindrances, Setting Rules, spells, weapons, gear, </p>
<p>monsters, and more! We talk more about some of </p>
<p>our settings on pages 7 through 15.</p>
<p>The.Adventure.Deck</p>
<p>We also make an exciting Adventure Deck that </p>
<p>adds an additional aspect of player control to the </p>
<p>game. Your hero might find a new romance, make </p>
<p>a lifelong enemy, or do additional damage in that </p>
<p>critical fight. Look for it on our website or in better </p>
<p>game and hobby stores.</p>
<p>Using.Miniatures</p>
<p>The rules are written for the table-top because </p>
<p>that  requires  exact  measurements  and  precise </p>
<p>rules.  That’s  why  all  the  weapon  ranges  and </p>
<p>movement values are listed in inches (rather than </p>
<p>yards or some other unit). Using miniatures and </p>
<p>terrain or a battle-mat can really help your players </p>
<p>understand the tactical situation and better interact </p>
<p>with their environment, and we highly recommend </p>
<p>this style of play for most games.</p>
<p>But  miniatures  certainly  aren’t  required,  and </p>
<p>you’ll find rules for “guesstimating” ranges, how </p>
<p>many foes are caught in a blast radius, and other </p>
<p>issues on page 73.</p>
<p>If you do decide to use miniatures, check the </p>
<p>Pinnacle  website  for  metal  miniatures  for  our </p>
<p>games  as  well  as  cardboard  and  cardstock </p>
<p>variants.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--6</p>
<p>Savage.Settings</p>
<p>Pinnacle has created many Savage Settings, from </p>
<p>our award-winning Deadlands and its spin-offs Hell </p>
<p>on Earth and Lost Colony to Rippers and Necessary </p>
<p>Evil and Weird Wars. We’ve also licensed some of </p>
<p>our favorite worlds, such as Frank Chadwick’s Space </p>
<p>1889® and The Savage World of Solomon Kane®. </p>
<p>A few of our settings, such as Andy Hopp’s brilliant </p>
<p>Low Life, are published by Pinnacle but owned by </p>
<p>their creators.</p>
<p>You’ll find a sneak peek at a few of these settings </p>
<p>on the following pages.</p>
<p>Plot.Point.Campaigns</p>
<p>Like our rules system, our settings are designed </p>
<p>to be easy for the Game Master to run. That’s why </p>
<p>many  of  our  Savage  Settings  feature  “Plot  Point </p>
<p>Campaigns,”  a  backstory  to  the  campaign  world </p>
<p>and a set of adventures that resolve the main plot. </p>
<p>Interspersed between these Plot Points are Savage </p>
<p>Tales—short adventures that can be run depending </p>
<p>on where the party goes and what they do. Of course </p>
<p>a Game Master can also insert his own adventures </p>
<p>into the campaign, including those based around the </p>
<p>player characters’ backstories.</p>
<p>The idea is to communicate a big backstory—like </p>
<p>the flooding of the world in 50 Fathoms—but still give </p>
<p>Game Masters the freedom to construct and run their </p>
<p>own stories in the foreground. In this game, the heroes </p>
<p>are a crew of explorers, traders, or even pirates sailing </p>
<p>about a drowning world. They can seek out whatever </p>
<p>destiny they choose, but will become entangled in the </p>
<p>fight against the Sea Hags—the creatures destroying </p>
<p>Caribdus—as well.</p>
<p>Savage.Tales</p>
<p>The adventures in our books are called “Savage </p>
<p>Tales,” short and direct adventure outlines the Game </p>
<p>Master can run with only a few minutes of preparation. </p>
<p>We do this by cutting to the  most  important  details </p>
<p>of an encounter.</p>
<p>Ideally, </p>
<p>a </p>
<p>Game </p>
<p>Master  can  find  out </p>
<p>what  his  group  is </p>
<p>interested in doing that </p>
<p>session, read no more </p>
<p>than a page or so, and </p>
<p>be  ready  to  run  the </p>
<p>game. He can always </p>
<p>put  more into it if he </p>
<p>wishes,  but  all  the </p>
<p>crucial ingredients for </p>
<p>running  a  fun  game </p>
<p>are there in detail.</p>
<p>Savagery</p>
<p>If you decide you like Savage Worlds, you might </p>
<p>want  to  check  out  some  of  our  settings  and  other </p>
<p>resources. Some basic information is found below, </p>
<p>and you can find more detail, free downloads, and </p>
<p>support materials at our website: www.peginc.com.</p>
<p>Settings</p>
<p>From space opera to Western to Puritan adventures, </p>
<p>we make a lot of exciting settings. Our philosophy </p>
<p>has always been to do things a little differently than </p>
<p>everyone  else.  Most  of  our  worlds  have  a  unique </p>
<p>twist  we  think  makes  them  special.  For  example, </p>
<p>Evernight begins in a typical fantasy world of elves </p>
<p>and dwarves—but quickly changes as strange spikes </p>
<p>drop  from  the  heavens  and  spill  forth  something </p>
<p>terrible from beyond the stars.</p>
<p>Some of our largest game lines, such as Deadlands, </p>
<p>are open settings with multiple Plot Point Campaigns </p>
<p>presented  separately.  For  example,  The  Flood </p>
<p>revolves around fighting Reverend Ezekiah Grimme </p>
<p>in what’s left of California after the Great Quake—the </p>
<p>Maze. Stone and a Hard Place is all about the game’s </p>

<p>Chapter.One:.</p>
<p>Characters</p>
<p>Great  heroes  are  more  than  a  collection  of </p>
<p>statistics  and  numbers,  but  in  a  game  system </p>
<p>this is certainly where they begin. To make your </p>
<p>hero, download a <i>Savage Worlds</i> character sheet </p>
<p>from our website (www.peginc.com) or copy the </p>
<p>one found at the back of this book and follow the </p>
<p>steps below.</p>
<p>1..Race</p>
<p>Humans are the most common characters, but </p>
<p>some settings<b> </b>may feature bizarre aliens, graceful </p>
<p>elves, or other exotic races—some examples of </p>
<p>which you’ll find on page 20. You can choose to </p>
<p>play any race available in your particular setting.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Humans  are  the  standard  race  in <i> Savage </i></p>
<p><i>Worlds, </i>and start play with one free Edge </p>
<p>(see Step 3).</p>
<p>2..Traits</p>
<p>Characters are defined by attributes and skills, </p>
<p>collectively called “Traits,” and both work in exactly </p>
<p>the same way. Attributes and skills are ranked by </p>
<p>die types, from a d4 to a d12, with d6 being the </p>
<p>average for adult humans. Higher is better!</p>
<p>Attributes</p>
<p>Every character starts with a d4 in each attribute, </p>
<p>and has 5 points with which to raise them. Raising </p>
<p>a d4 to a d6, for example, costs 1 point. You’re free </p>
<p>to spend these points however you want with one </p>
<p>exception: no attribute may be raised above a d12.</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Agility </b>is your hero’s nimbleness, quickness, </p>
<p>and dexterity.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Smarts</b>  is  a  measure  of  how  well  your </p>
<p>character knows his world and culture, how </p>
<p>well he thinks on his feet, and mental agility.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Spirit </b>reflects inner wisdom and willpower. </p>
<p>Spirit  is  very  important  as  it  helps  your </p>
<p>character recover from being Shaken (see </p>
<p>page 77).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Strength</b> is raw physical power and general </p>
<p>fitness.  Strength  is  also  used  to  generate </p>
<p>your  warrior’s  damage  in  hand-to-hand </p>
<p>combat.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Vigor</b> represents endurance, resistance to </p>
<p>disease, poison, or toxins, and how much </p>
<p>pain and physical damage a hero can shake </p>
<p>off.</p>
<p>Skills</p>
<p>Skills  are  learned  abilities  such  as  Shooting, </p>
<p>Fighting,  scientific  knowledge,  professional </p>
<p>aptitudes,  and  so  on. These  are  very  general </p>
<p>descriptions  which  cover  all  related  aspects. </p>
<p>Shooting, for example, covers all types of guns, </p>
<p>bows,  rocket  launchers,  and  other  ranged </p>
<p>weapons.</p>
<p>You  have  15  skill  points  to  distribute  among </p>
<p>your skills. Each die type costs 1 point (starting </p>
<p>at d4) as long as the skill is equal to or less than </p>
<p>the attribute it’s linked to (listed beside the skill in </p>
<p>parentheses). If you exceed the attribute, the cost </p>
<p>becomes 2 points per die type.</p>
<p>As  with  attributes,  no  skill  may  be  increased </p>
<p>above d12.</p>
<p><i><b>Example:</b>  Fighting  is  linked  to Agility. A </i></p>
<p><i>character with a d8 Agility can buy Fighting </i></p>
<p><i>for one point per die type to d8. Buying a </i></p>
<p><i>d10 costs 2 points, and a d12 costs another </i></p>
<p><i>2 points.</i></p>
<p>Derived.Statistics</p>
<p>Your  character  sheet  contains  a  few  other </p>
<p>statistics you need to fill in, described below.</p>
<p><b>Charisma </b> is  a  measure  of  your  character’s </p>
<p>appearance,  manner,  and  general  likability.  It’s </p>
<p>0  unless  you  have  Edges  or  Hindrances  that </p>
<p>modify it. Charisma is added to Persuasion and </p>
<p>Streetwise rolls, and is used by the GM to figure </p>
<p>out how nonplayer characters react to your hero.</p>
<p><b>Pace </b> is  how  fast  your  character  moves  in  a </p>
<p>standard  combat  round.  Humans  walk  6”  in  a </p>
<p>round and can move an additional 1d6” if they run. </p>
<p>Write “6” on your character sheet beside the word </p>
<p>Pace. This is 6” on the table-top—every inch there </p>
<p>represents 2 yards in the “real world.”</p>
<p><b>Parry </b>is equal to 2 plus half your character’s </p>
<p>Fighting (2 if a character does not have Fighting), </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--17</p>
<p>plus any bonuses for shields or certain weapons. </p>
<p>This is the Target Number (TN) to hit your hero in </p>
<p>hand-to-hand combat.</p>
<p>For  stats  such  as  d12+1,  add  half  the  fixed </p>
<p>modifier, rounded down. For instance, a Fighting </p>
<p>skill of d12+1 grants a Parry of 8 (2+half of d12), </p>
<p>whereas a d12+2 gives a Parry of 9 (2+half of </p>
<p>d12+2).</p>
<p><b>Toughness</b> is your hero’s damage threshold. </p>
<p>Anything  over  this  causes  him  to  be  rattled  or </p>
<p>worse. Toughness is 2 plus half your hero’s Vigor, </p>
<p>plus Armor  (use  the  armor  worn  on  his  torso). </p>
<p>Vigor over a d12 is calculated just like Parry.</p>
<p>3..Edges.&amp;.Hindrances</p>
<p>Great heroes are far more than a collection of </p>
<p>skills and attributes. It’s their unique gifts, special </p>
<p>powers,  and  tragic  flaws  that  truly  make  them </p>
<p>interesting characters.</p>
<p>Characters can take Edges by balancing them </p>
<p>out with Hindrances. You’ll find a complete list of </p>
<p>Edges and Hindrances later in this chapter. Look </p>
<p>for more in our Savage Settings.</p>
<p>You  can  take  one  Major  Hindrance  and  two </p>
<p>Minor Hindrances. A Major Hindrance is worth 2 </p>
<p>points, and a Minor Hindrance is worth 1 point.</p>
<p><b>For 2 points you can:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Raise an attribute one die type, or</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Choose an Edge</p>
<p><b>For 1 point you can:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Gain another skill point, or</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Gain additional money equal to your starting </p>
<p>funds  (if  you  start  with  $500,  you  gain  an </p>
<p>additional $500)</p>
<p>4..Gear</p>
<p>Next you need to purchase equipment. Some </p>
<p>settings may provide your hero with all the gear he </p>
<p>needs. In others, you may be assigned a certain </p>
<p>amount  of  money  with  which  to purchase your </p>
<p>starting gear. A list of some common gear and </p>
<p>weapons can be found in Chapter Two.</p>
<p>Unless your setting book or GM says otherwise, </p>
<p>the standard starting amount is $500.</p>
<p>5..Background.Details</p>
<p>Finish your character by filling in any history or </p>
<p>background you care to. Ask yourself why your </p>
<p>hero is where she is and what her goals are. Or </p>
<p>you can just start playing and fill in these details </p>
<p>as they become important.</p>
<p>You might also want to talk to the other players. </p>
<p>Maybe  your  characters  know  each  other  right </p>
<p>from the start. Or you might collectively decide to </p>
<p>optimize your group a bit and ensure you’ve got a </p>
<p>good assortment of skills and abilities. If so, make </p>
<p>sure you’re playing what you want to play. There’s </p>
<p>no point in being the party’s magical healer, for </p>
<p>example, if that’s not a role you’re interested in.</p>
<p>Design.Note.-.Roleplaying</p>
<p><i>Most of us tend to play a particular character </i></p>
<p><i>type and stick with it regardless of genre or </i></p>
<p><i>game  system.  There’s  certainly  nothing </i></p>
<p><i>wrong with that, and you should absolutely </i></p>
<p><i>play what you enjoy most of the time.</i></p>
<p><i>It’s  also  great  to  occasionally  break  out </i></p>
<p><i>of  your  usual  mold  and  try  something </i></p>
<p><i>different.  Challenge  yourself  to  play  a </i></p>
<p><i>different character type now and then. Maybe </i></p>
<p><i>you always play big tough guys and like being </i></p>
<p><i>the “brick” of the party. Next time your friend </i></p>
<p><i>runs  a  swords  &amp;  sorcery  game,  try  being </i></p>
<p><i>the  mage. You  may  find  you  love  being  a </i></p>
<p><i>spellcaster.</i></p>
<p><i>Game  Masters  are  also  encouraged  to </i></p>
<p><i>try new things now and then. Some of the </i></p>
<p><i>most  incredible  sessions  we’ve  played  in </i></p>
<p><i>have featured very strange character types, </i></p>
<p><i>such as kobold slaves, the elderly, and even </i></p>
<p><i>intelligent  animals. And  nothing  beats  the </i></p>
<p><i>bizarre and amazing world of Andy Hopp’s </i></p>
<p>Low Life.</p>
<p><i>We  encourage </i></p>
<p><i>y o u  </i></p>
<p><i>t o  </i></p>
<p><i>t r y </i></p>
<p><i>something  new </i></p>
<p><i>once in  a while. </i></p>
<p><i>You can always </i></p>
<p><i>slip  right  back </i></p>
<p><i>into  that  very </i></p>
<p><i>comfortable </i></p>
<p><i>and  familiar </i></p>
<p><i>r o l e  </i></p>
<p><i>y o u </i></p>
<p><i>already know </i></p>
<p><i>y o u  </i></p>
<p><i>e n j o y </i></p>
<p><i>next time out.</i></p>

<p>Archetypes</p>
<p>Sometimes you may want to quickly create a </p>
<p>character for a one-shot or convention adventure. </p>
<p>For  those  occasions,  an Archetype  might  be  a </p>

<p><i>Making  characters  in  Savage  Worlds  is </i></p>

<p>Races</p>
<p>Not every hero is human. Below are sample races </p>
<p>common to many science fiction and fantasy settings. </p>
<p>Use  them  as  they  are  or  modify  them  to  fit  your </p>
<p>particular  world.  Immediately  after  you’ll  also  find </p>
<p>guidelines on how to create your own races.</p>
<p>Android</p>
<p>Androids are sentient machines with a variety of </p>
<p>appearances depending on the setting. Some appear </p>
<p>almost  human,  some  are  purely  mechanical. The </p>
<p>android presented here is a basic version with normal </p>
<p>human knowledge and emotions. Particular settings </p>
<p>may alter, remove, or add other abilities based on </p>
<p>their role and function in that world.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Asimov  Circuits:</b>  The  android  cannot  harm,  or  by </p>
<p>inaction bring harm to sentient beings. This gives him </p>
<p>the Pacifist Hindrance (Major).</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Construct:</b> Androids  add  +2  to  recover  from  being </p>
<p>Shaken, don’t suffer wound modifiers, and are immune </p>
<p>to poison and disease. Androids cannot heal naturally. </p>
<p>To heal an android requires the Repair skill—which is </p>
<p>used like the Healing skill only with no “Golden Hour.”</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Outsider:</b> Organic races often mistrust or misunderstand </p>
<p>androids. They  subtract  2  from  their  Charisma  when </p>
<p>dealing with races other than their own.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Programming:</b> Androids begin with a free d6 in one skill, </p>
<p>representing their original programmed role. </p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Recharge:</b> During character creation, the player must </p>
<p>determine the  android’s  power source. If the android </p>
<p>cannot  access  his  power  source  at  least  once  per </p>
<p>day,  he’s  automatically  Fatigued  each  day  until  he’s </p>
<p>Incapacitated. The day after that, he goes “off-line” and </p>
<p>must be revived with a Repair roll and a four-hour charge </p>
<p>of energy. The power source replaces the need for food </p>
<p>and water, unless they are the chosen power source.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Unnatural:</b> Arcane  powers,  both  detrimental  and </p>
<p>beneficial, suffer a –2 penalty to affect androids. This </p>
<p>has no effect on damaging powers, which affect them </p>
<p>normally.</p>
<p>Atlantean</p>
<p>From  the  crushing  depths  come  the  mysterious </p>
<p>folk known as Atlanteans. They are thick and sturdy </p>
<p>beneath the waves but often vulnerable in the dry air </p>
<p>or searing heat. Their civilization is advanced, and </p>
<p>Atlantean science is a wonder to behold.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Advanced Civilization:</b> Atlanteans are generally more </p>
<p>intelligent than the other races of their world. They start </p>
<p>with a d6 in Smarts rather than a d4.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Aquatic:</b> Atlanteans  live  in  and  breathe  water. They </p>
<p>cannot drown in water, move at full Swimming skill, and </p>
<p>get a free d6 Swimming.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Dehydration:</b> Atlanteans must immerse themselves in </p>
<p>water one hour out of every 24 or become automatically </p>
<p>Fatigued each day until they are Incapacitated. The day </p>
<p>after that, they perish.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Tough:</b>  The  pressure  of  their  deep  homes  make </p>
<p>Atlanteans tougher than most. Increase Toughness by 1.</p>
<p>Avion</p>
<p>Avions are any basically human race with wings. They </p>
<p>tend to be very slight of build owing to their hollow bones.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Flight:</b> Avions can fly at their basic Pace and even “run” </p>
<p>while flying. It costs 2” of Pace to gain 1” of height.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Hollow-boned:</b> Avions have –1 Toughness.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Mostly Human:</b> Avions may choose one free Edge at </p>
<p>character creation as long as they meet all requirements.</p>
<p>Dwarves</p>
<p>Dwarves are short, stout, hardy people who come </p>
<p>from massive caverns in the high mountains. They are </p>
<p>a proud, warlike race, usually made so by frequent </p>
<p>contact with savage races such as orcs and goblins.</p>
<p>Dwarves usually live upwards of 200 years. In most </p>
<p>fantasy  campaigns,  they  have  ruddy  skin  and  all </p>
<p>human hair colors.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Low Light Vision:</b> Dwarven eyes are accustomed to the </p>
<p>dark of the underearth. They ignore attack penalties for </p>
<p>Dim and Dark lighting.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Slow:</b> Dwarves have a Pace of 5”.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Tough:</b> Dwarves are stout and tough. They start with a </p>
<p>d6 Vigor instead of a d4.</p>
<p>Elves</p>
<p>Elves are tall, thin souls with pointed ears and deep-</p>
<p>set eyes of various colors. Whether they hail from </p>
<p>the forests or hidden valleys, they are all born more </p>
<p>graceful  than  humans,  though  somewhat  slighter. </p>
<p>Most elves live upwards of 300 years. They have fair </p>
<p>skin and  their  hair includes  all human colors,  plus </p>
<p>shades of silver and blue.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Agile:</b> Elves are graceful and agile. They start with a d6 </p>
<p>in Agility instead of a d4.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>All Thumbs:</b> Elves have an inbred dislike of mechanical </p>
<p>objects, and thus have the All Thumbs Hindrance. They </p>
<p>shun most mechanical items and designs.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Low Light Vision:</b> Elven eyes amplify light like a cat’s, </p>
<p>allowing them to see in the dark. Elves ignores attack </p>
<p>penalties for Dim and Dark lighting.</p>
<p>Half-Elves</p>
<p>Half-elves  are  usually  a  solid  mix  of  their  two </p>
<p>parents. They gain the elves’ grace but none of their </p>
<p>elegant  frailty.  Most  half-elves  are  well-adjusted, </p>
<p>but some are shunned by one side of the family or </p>
<p>the other and grow resentful. Others may even be </p>
<p>mistreated. Their lifespans are closer to their human </p>
<p>parent than those of their elven kin. Most half-elves </p>
<p>live only to about 100 years.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Heritage:</b>  Some  half-elves  retain  the  grace  of  their </p>
<p>elven parent. Others gain the adaptability of their human </p>
<p>ancestry. A half-elf may either start with a free Edge of </p>
<p>his choice (as a human), or a d6 in Agility instead of a d4.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Low Light Vision:</b> The character’s eyes amplify light </p>
<p>like a cat’s, allowing him to see in the dark. He ignores </p>
<p>attack penalties for Dim and Dark lighting.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Outsider:</b> Half-elves aren’t true outsiders (as per the </p>
<p>Hindrance of the same name), but neither are they ever </p>
<p>quite comfortable around humans or elves as one of their </p>
<p>own, so the effect is the same.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--21</p>
<p>Character.Creation</p>
<p>Half-Folk</p>
<p>Half-folk are small, nimble creatures with fuzzy brown or </p>
<p>black hair. Though they are frail compared to most other </p>
<p>races, their cheerful optimism (or wily cunning) gives them a </p>
<p>“never say die” attitude that makes them more than a match </p>
<p>for creatures twice their size.</p>
<p>Half-folk see no reason to invite trouble, and tend to live in </p>
<p>their own little communities far off the beaten path.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Fortunate:</b>  Half-folk  draw  one  additional  Benny  per </p>
<p>game session. This may be combined with the Luck and </p>
<p>Great Luck Edges.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Short:</b> Half-folk average only about 4’ tall. This gives </p>
<p>them a Size of –1 and subtracts 1 from their Toughness. </p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Spirited:</b> Half-folk are generally optimistic beings. They </p>
<p>start with a d6 Spirit instead of a d4.</p>
<p>Half-Orcs</p>
<p>Half-orcs are the offspring of either a human and </p>
<p>an orc or an orc and another half-orc. Rarely is such </p>
<p>a mating willingly accepted, so the character’s </p>
<p>“family  tree”  is  likely  more  than  a  little </p>
<p>troublesome to him or her.</p>
<p>Half-orcs are usually accepted by </p>
<p>orcish communities, but are shunned </p>
<p>by  most  other  races,  including </p>
<p>humans,  elves,  and  dwarves.  Some </p>
<p>half-orcs  choose  to  join  the  “civilized” </p>
<p>races, turning their backs on their barbaric </p>
<p>roots,  and  are  often  looking  to  redeem </p>
<p>themselves. Many are heroic souls trying </p>
<p>to prove their worth.</p>
<p>Half-orcs  have  light-colored  human </p>
<p>skin  with  just  a  tinge  of  orcish </p>
<p>coloration,  with  black  hair  and </p>
<p>small  eyes. Their  features  are </p>
<p>harsh  and  angular,  like  that  of </p>
<p>orcs. Their natural life-span is the </p>
<p>same  as  humans,  though  it  is  rare </p>
<p>when one dies of old age.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Infravision:</b>  Half-orcs  can  see  in </p>
<p>the  infrared  spectrum,  halving  attack </p>
<p>penalties (round down) for bad lighting.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Outsider:</b> Half-orcs aren’t trusted by most </p>
<p>other  civilized  races,  and  so  subtract  2 </p>
<p>from their Charisma.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Strong:</b> Half-orcs have some of the strength </p>
<p>of their ancestry. They start with a d6 </p>
<p>Strength attribute instead of a d4.</p>
<p>Humans</p>
<p>Humans  in  most  settings  should  get </p>
<p>the usual benefit — one free Edge of their choice. </p>
<p>This option reflects their versatility and adaptability </p>
<p>compared to other races.</p>
<p>If you like more variety, you might also give humans </p>
<p>abilities  based  on  culture  rather  than  race.  For </p>
<p>instance, a seafaring human culture may start with </p>
<p>Boating and Swimming at d6. Cultural templates are </p>
<p>designed just like making new races (see page 22).</p>
<p>Rakashans</p>
<p>Rakashans  have  the  form  of  humans  with  the </p>
<p>features  of  felines. They  come  in  a  wide  variety: </p>
<p>the  bright  colors  of  tigers,  the  speckled  hides  of </p>
<p>leopards, and the exotic look of Siamese cats are all </p>
<p>appropriate. They have sharp claws and teeth and a </p>
<p>cruel nature when it comes to dealing with their prey.</p>
<p>Rakashans can be found in their own remote and </p>
<p>exotic cities or as fringe elements of normal society. </p>
<p>While they are too beautiful to be shunned, they are </p>
<p>too foreign to be easily accepted.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Agile:</b>  Rakashans  have  the  feline  grace  of  their </p>
<p>ancestors. They start with a d6 Agility attribute instead </p>
<p>of a d4.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Bloodthirsty:</b>  Rakashans  can  be  cruel  to  their  foes, </p>
<p>often  toying  with  them  for  simple  amusement. They </p>
<p>rarely take prisoners and feel little compunction about </p>
<p>punishing captured foes. This causes a –4 Charisma </p>
<p>penalty among more “civilized” types.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Racial  Enemy:</b>  Rakashan  society  rose  at  the </p>
<p>expense of another. Pick a common race in your setting. </p>
<p>Members of each culture suffer a –4 Charisma when </p>
<p>dealing with each other. Unless fettered by other </p>
<p>authorities or common goals, individuals of the two </p>
<p>races typically attack each other on sight.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Claws:</b>  Rakashans  have  retractable </p>
<p>claws  that  do  Str+d6  damage  and  grant  +2 </p>
<p>to Climbing rolls on all but completely sheer </p>
<p>surfaces.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Low  Light  Vision:</b>  Rakashan  eyes </p>
<p>amplify light. They can see in the dark </p>
<p>and ignore attack penalties for Dim and </p>
<p>Dark lighting.</p>
<p>Saurians</p>
<p>Lizard  men  typically  come  from </p>
<p>steaming  jungles  or  deep </p>
<p>deserts where they have unique </p>
<p>civilizations  unknown  to  other </p>
<p>sentient races.</p>
<p>Few outsiders have penetrated </p>
<p>their  society,  and  persistent </p>
<p>rumors  that  Saurian  religion </p>
<p>requires  sentient  sacrifices  remain </p>
<p>unconfirmed.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Outsider:</b>  Most  races  distrust  the </p>
<p>unblinking saurians. Their habit of eating </p>
<p>their meat still squirming is also less than </p>
<p>appetizing.  They  suffer  a  –2  Charisma </p>
<p>penalty.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Natural  Weapons:</b> The  tails,  claws, </p>
<p>and teeth of saurians allow them to tail slap, claw, </p>
<p>or bite in combat for Str+d4 damage.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Saurian  Senses:</b>  Saurians’  lizard </p>
<p>tongues can “taste” the air, giving them +2 to Notice </p>
<p>rolls. They are always considered active guards for </p>
<p>Stealth checks.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Warm Natured:</b> Though not truly cold-blooded, </p>
<p>saurians are not comfortable in cold environments. </p>
<p>They suffer a –4 penalty to resist cold environmental </p>
<p>effects.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--22</p>
<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p>Making.Races</p>
<p>The following system allows you to make new races </p>
<p>or cultural templates like those found on the previous </p>
<p>pages. The Game Master can use this to create pre-</p>
<p>built races for his world, or allow players to do so if </p>
<p>the setting allows a great number of racial variations.</p>
<p>If you’re the Game Master, decide on the maximum </p>
<p>number  of  Racial  Edge  points  allowed  (usually </p>
<p>between 2 and 4). This provides enough scope to </p>
<p>make an interesting race or culture without unduly </p>
<p>unbalancing the game.</p>
<p>Races and cultures begin with a free +2 Racial </p>
<p>Ability. This is equivalent to a human’s Free Edge. </p>
<p>Additional positive abilities must be countered with </p>
<p>an  equal  value  of  negative  ones. A  +2  ability,  for </p>
<p>example, may be countered by a single –2 ability or </p>
<p>two –1 abilities. </p>
<p>Give each ability a suitable name. If you want your </p>
<p>horse nomads to have Riding skill at d6, call it Born to </p>
<p>the Saddle. It’s all about creating a rich flavor rather </p>
<p>than just giving long lists of abilities your players have </p>
<p>to keep up with. Short and flavorful is far preferable </p>
<p>to long and comprehensive.</p>
<p>If you want to include an ability we haven’t listed </p>
<p>here, simply assign it a value based on the examples </p>
<p>here.</p>

<p>Skills</p>
<p>On the following pages are skills available in </p>
<p>most  Savage  Settings.  Normal  use  of  a  skill—</p>
<p>guiding a boat in and out of a dock, repairing an </p>
<p>engine with plenty of time and the proper tools, or </p>
<p>riding a horse across a prairie—shouldn’t require a </p>
<p>skill roll. Only when a character is under pressure </p>
<p>to  perform  a  task  quickly,  or  has  a  significant </p>
<p>chance of failure and can’t just keep trying until </p>
<p>he’s successful, should his player be asked to roll.</p>
<p>Familiarization</p>
<p>Skills  are  very  broad  for  ease  of  play,  but </p>
<p>sometimes  it’s  dramatically  appropriate  to </p>
<p>emphasize when a character is out of his element.</p>
<p>When  a  hero  finds  himself  using  a  skill  in  a </p>
<p>dramatically different way than he’s used to, he </p>
<p>suffers a  –2  penalty  to  his  rolls. How  long this </p>
<p>lasts depends on the skill, but should typically be </p>
<p>at least a few days of casual use, or a few hours </p>
<p>of more intensive use.</p>
<p>What  a  character  is  familiar  with  should  be </p>
<p>based  on  his  background  and  any  character </p>
<p>history the player has written up, with the Game </p>
<p>Master having the final say.</p>
<p>If you want more in-depth rules, see the Skill </p>
<p>Specialization Setting Rules on page 110.</p>
<p>Common.Knowledge</p>
<p>Instead of asking characters to have dozens of </p>
<p>background skills they rarely need in actual play, </p>
<p>we use the concept of “Common Knowledge.” Your </p>
<p>hero knows the basic history of his land, common </p>
<p>etiquette, how to get around geographically, how </p>
<p>to  operate  common  machinery  or  equipment </p>
<p>native to his time period and location, and who </p>
<p>the major players in his locality are. A Common </p>
<p>Knowledge roll is made by rolling the adventurer’s </p>
<p>Smarts attribute.</p>
<p>If a character’s background suggests he should </p>
<p>know  something  about  a  subject  and  he  must </p>
<p>make a roll, add +2 if most in his area or profession </p>
<p>would know the answer. If the subject is foreign </p>
<p>to a character, subtract 2 or more from the roll. </p>
<p>Everyone else breaks even and gets no modifier.</p>
<p>If  it  becomes  important  to  know  how  well  a </p>
<p>character performs a common task, the GM can </p>
<p>ask  for  whatever  roll  is  appropriate.  Knowing </p>
<p>how to do a dance, for example, is a Common </p>
<p>Knowledge  roll.  If  it  becomes  important  to  see </p>
<p>how  well  a  character  performs  the  dance,  the </p>
<p>GM might ask for an Agility roll (with no bonuses </p>
<p>or penalties).</p>
<p>For example, an adventure might read: “Anyone </p>
<p>who makes a Common Knowledge roll detects </p>
<p>that this cavern was carved by civilized hands, </p>
<p>not formed naturally.” A dwarf knows more about </p>
<p>stonework than an elf, so give the dwarf a +2 on </p>
<p>the roll. A human has about average knowledge, </p>
<p>so  no  bonus  is  granted. An  elf  who  has  spent </p>
<p>most of his life in a forest won’t know much about </p>
<p>stonework, so the roll is at a –2 penalty.</p>
<p>Specific.Knowledge</p>
<p>The  Knowledge  skill  represents  deeper </p>
<p>specialization in a chosen subject. A dwarf with </p>
<p>Knowledge  (Stonework),  for  example,  not  only </p>
<p>knows the dungeon was carved, but might just </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--24</p>
<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p>know what race did it and the era in which it was </p>
<p>first excavated. He might also be able to locate </p>
<p>stress points that can cause a cave-in! Knowledge </p>
<p>of a particular region is also handy. In a fantasy </p>
<p>campaign,  for  example,  locals  might  know  the </p>
<p>Dread  Mountains  are  home  to  vicious  harpies. </p>
<p>A  hero  with  Knowledge  (Dread  Mountains) </p>
<p>might know a safe route or the specific peak the </p>
<p>creatures’ aerie is in.</p>
<p>Knowledge skills should be used for subjects </p>
<p>that have a significant impact during the game. If </p>
<p>the subject comes up  very rarely, use Common </p>
<p>Knowledge instead.</p>
<p>Skill.List</p>
<p>Boating.(Agility)</p>
<p>Characters with this skill can handle most any </p>
<p>boat or ship common to their setting and character </p>
<p>background. They generally know how to handle </p>
<p>common tasks associated with their vessels as </p>
<p>well (tying knots, rigging sails, etc.).</p>
<p>Climbing.(Strength)</p>
<p>Characters may sometimes have to climb tall </p>
<p>objects under duress, perhaps to scale a cliff to </p>
<p>attack  archers  stationed  above,  or  to  evade  a </p>
<p>terrifying creature on the ground below!</p>
<p>No  roll  is  usually  needed  to  ascend  ladders, </p>
<p>ropes, or trees with lots of limbs unless the GM feels </p>
<p>there’s a good reason (being chased, wounded, </p>
<p>etc.).  In  more  stressful  situations,  a  character </p>
<p>makes  a  Climbing  roll  and  checks  the  results </p>
<p>below.  Remember  that  these  measurements </p>
<p>are  listed  in  table-top  inches,  with  each  inch </p>
<p>representing two yards in the real world.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Fail: </b> The  character  makes  no  progress.  If  the </p>
<p>Climbing roll is a total of 1 or less, he falls to the </p>
<p>next level below—whatever that may be. See Falling </p>
<p>damage on page 101. If the hero was secured by a </p>
<p>rope or other restraint, he falls half the length of the </p>
<p>restraint and suffers a Fatigue level instead.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Success:</b> The hero ascends a number of vertical </p>
<p>inches on the table-top equal to half his Strength. A </p>
<p>hero with a d6 Strength, for example, can climb 3” </p>
<p>in a round if he makes his Climbing roll.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Raise:</b> As  Success,  above,  but  the  character </p>
<p>moves an additional 2”.</p>

<p><b>Prepared Climbs:</b> Break lengthy ascents into </p>
<p>three roughly even sections. Failing a Climbing roll </p>
<p>after a break point typically means the hero falls </p>
<p>that distance if free-climbing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Ropes:</b> Those secured with a rope typically </p>
<p>only  suffer  a  level  of  Fatigue  from  Bumps  and </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--25</p>
<p>Character.Creation</p>
<p>Bruises  (see  page  99).  Of  course  the  Game </p>
<p>Master might decide the rope has a chance of </p>
<p>breaking under a sudden strain. This is rare in </p>
<p>reality, but for dramatic effect, roll a d6. On a 1, </p>
<p>the rope breaks and the character falls the entire </p>
<p>length of the last section climbed. </p>
<p>Driving.(Agility)</p>
<p>Driving allows your hero to control ground and </p>
<p>hover vehicles common to his setting. Rules for </p>
<p>handling vehicles on the table-top can be found </p>
<p>on page 113. Driving is also frequently used with </p>
<p>the Chase rules, described on page 94.</p>
<p>Fighting.(Agility)</p>
<p>Fighting  covers  all  hand-to-hand  (melee) </p>
<p>attacks, whether it’s with fists, axes, laser swords, </p>
<p>or martial arts. The TN to hit an opponent is his </p>
<p>Parry (2 plus half his Fighting). See Chapter Three </p>
<p>for the combat rules and numerous maneuvers </p>
<p>your warrior might attempt.</p>
<p>Gambling.(Smarts)</p>
<p>Gambling  is  useful  from  the  saloons  of  the </p>
<p>Old West to the barracks of most armies. Here’s </p>
<p>a  quick  way  to  simulate  about  a  half-hour  of </p>
<p>gambling without having to roll for every single </p>
<p>toss of the dice or hand of cards.</p>
<p>First have everyone agree on the stakes, such </p>
<p>as $10, 10 gold coins, etc. Now have everyone in </p>
<p>the game make a Gambling roll. The lowest total </p>
<p>pays  the  highest  total  the  difference  times  the </p>
<p>stake. The next lowest pays the second highest </p>
<p>the difference times the stake, and so on. If there’s </p>
<p>an odd man left in the middle, he breaks even.</p>
<p><i><b>Example:</b> Kali rolls highest with a 10 and </i></p>
<p><i>Yuri rolls lowest with a 4. The difference is 6, </i></p>
<p><i>so Yuri pays Kali 6 x the stake of $10, or $60.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Cheating: </b>A character who cheats adds +2 to </p>
<p>his roll. The GM may raise or lower this modifier </p>
<p>depending on the particulars of the game or the </p>
<p>method of cheating. If the player ever rolls a 1 </p>
<p>on his skill die (regardless of his Wild Die), he’s </p>
<p>caught. The consequences of this depend on the </p>
<p>setting, but are usually quite harsh.</p>
<p>Design.Note.-.Guts</p>
<p><i>Where did the Guts skill go? We removed </i></p>
<p><i>it. It’s important to some settings (and you’ll </i></p>
<p><i>find it as a Setting Rule when it is), but rare </i></p>
<p><i>in others. Where it’s rare, however, even a </i></p>
<p><i>mighty barbarian has to spend valuable skill </i></p>
<p><i>points to prove his mettle with the Guts skill, </i></p>
<p><i>and that really doesn’t make much sense.</i></p>
<p><i>In  the  core  rules  and  most  settings </i></p>
<p><i>(especially  fantasy  and  sci-fi)  characters </i></p>
<p><i>now use Spirit to resist the effects of Fear. If </i></p>
<p><i>a character in a previously published setting </i></p>
<p><i>has Guts, ignore it. If you’re using a published </i></p>
<p><i>adventure that requires a Guts roll, use Spirit </i></p>
<p><i>instead. </i></p>
<p><i>In a few settings (primarily horrific ones, </i></p>
<p><i>like </i>Deadlands<i>), Guts is a Setting Rule that </i></p>
<p><i>reflects  the  particular  nature  of  the  game </i></p>
<p><i>world and remains intact.</i></p>
<p>Healing.(Smarts)</p>
<p>Healing  is  the  art  of  stopping  wounds  and </p>
<p>treating existing injuries. In general, every success </p>
<p>and raise on a Healing roll eliminates a wound. </p>
<p>The healer must subtract not only his own wounds </p>
<p>from the roll as usual, but those of his patient as </p>
<p>well.</p>
<p>See the Healing rules on page 87 for specific </p>
<p>information.</p>
<p>Intimidation.(Spirit)</p>
<p>Intimidation is the art of frightening an opponent </p>
<p>with sheer force of will, veiled or overt threats, </p>
<p>or  sometimes  just  really  big  guns.  This  is  an </p>
<p>opposed roll between the hero’s Intimidation and </p>
<p>his opponent’s Spirit. See Tests of Will on page </p>
<p>86 for game effects.</p>
<p>Investigation.(Smarts)</p>
<p>A character skilled in Investigation knows how to </p>
<p>make good use of libraries, newspaper morgues, </p>
<p>the internet, or other written sources of information. </p>
<p>To get information from people rather than books </p>
<p>and computers, use the Streetwise skill.</p>
<p>Knowledge.(Smarts)</p>
<p>Knowledge is a catch-all skill that must have a </p>
<p>focus of some sort, such as Knowledge (Occult) </p>
<p>or Knowledge (Science). The player can choose </p>
<p>the  focus  of  his  character’s  knowledge,  which </p>
<p>might  reflect  his  background  and  education. </p>
<p>The  skill  can  be  taken  multiple  times  with </p>
<p>different  focuses  to  reflect  different  areas  of </p>
<p>expertise. An archaeologist, for example, should </p>
<p>have  Knowledge  (History)  and  Knowledge </p>
<p>(Archaeology).</p>
<p>General focuses such as Knowledge (Science) </p>
<p>are acceptable, but the GM should give a bonus </p>
<p>to a character who has a focus more relevant to a </p>
<p>particular task, such as using Knowledge (Biology) </p>
<p>to identify a plant or animal.</p>
<p>Some Common Knowledge focuses are: Area </p>
<p>Knowledge,  Battle  (used  in  Mass  Battles,  see </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--26</p>
<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p>page  106),  Computers,  Electronics,  History, </p>
<p>Journalism,  various  languages,  Law,  Medicine </p>
<p>(though actually caring for someone is the Healing </p>
<p>skill), or Science.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Common  Knowledge: </b> Characters  don’t </p>
<p>need a Knowledge skill to know something about </p>
<p>a  particular  field.  Basic  information  should  be </p>
<p>covered by Common Knowledge (see page 26) </p>
<p>assuming  it  makes  sense  within  a  character’s </p>
<p>background. A  mercenary  with  a  penchant  for </p>
<p>reading or a young history student, for example, </p>
<p>doesn’t  necessarily  need  Knowledge  (History). </p>
<p>If tasked with a historical question, however, the </p>
<p>two might roll normally while those without such </p>
<p>a background roll at a penalty.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Languages: </b>Knowledge can also be used to </p>
<p>reflect knowing a language other than one’s own. </p>
<p>The higher the level, the better the character can </p>
<p>speak  and  mimic  regional  dialects,  as  shown </p>
<p>below.</p>
<p>In  settings  where  inhabitants  typically  speak </p>
<p>many languages, see the Languages Setting Rule </p>
<p>on page 109.</p>
<p>Knowledge.(Language).Table</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Skill </b></p>
<p><b>Ability</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>d4 </p>
<p>The  character  can  read,  write,  and </p>
<p>speak common words and phrases</p>
<p> </p>
<p>d6 </p>
<p>The speaker can carry on a prolonged </p>
<p>but occasionally halting conversation</p>
<p> </p>
<p>d8 </p>
<p>The character can speak fluently</p>
<p> </p>
<p>d10 </p>
<p>The  hero  can  mimic  other  dialects </p>
<p>within the language</p>
<p> </p>
<p>d12 </p>
<p>The  speaker  can  masterfully  recite </p>
<p>important literary or oral works</p>
<p>Lockpicking.(Agility)</p>
<p>Lockpicking is the ability to bypass mechanical </p>
<p>and electronic locks. Lockpicking is also used to </p>
<p>disarm the catches and triggers on traps, unless </p>
<p>a  more  relevant  skill  seems  appropriate  for  a </p>
<p>particular trap.</p>
<p>Notice.(Smarts)</p>
<p>Notice is a hero’s general alertness and ability to </p>
<p>search for items or clues. This covers hearing rolls, </p>
<p>detecting  ambushes,  spotting  hidden  weapons </p>
<p>and even scrutinizing other characters to see if </p>
<p>they’re  lying,  frightened,  and  so  on. The  more </p>
<p>raises a character gets on a Notice roll, the more </p>
<p>information the Game Master should reveal.</p>
<p>Persuasion.(Spirit)</p>
<p>Persuasion is the ability to convince others to </p>
<p>do what you want them to do.</p>
<p>Nonplayer characters start at one of five different </p>
<p>attitudes:  Hostile,  Uncooperative,  Neutral, </p>
<p>Friendly, or Helpful. A successful Persuasion roll </p>
<p>improves the Extra’s attitude one step, or two with </p>
<p>a raise. Failure, on the other hand, decreases the </p>
<p>character’s attitude by a step, or two if a 1 is rolled </p>
<p>on the Persuasion die (regardless of the Wild Die). </p>
<p>Most  Extras  won’t  change  their  reaction  more </p>
<p>than one or two levels during a single exchange, </p>
<p>but that’s entirely up to the Game Master and the </p>
<p>situation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Charisma: </b>Persuasion is always modified by </p>
<p>a character’s Charisma. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Player Characters:</b> Persuasion should never </p>
<p>be used on other player characters. Their attitudes </p>
<p>should be decided entirely by their players.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Reaction Table: </b>If the Game Master doesn’t </p>
<p>already  have  an  initial  attitude  in  mind  for  the </p>
<p>Extra, he can roll on the chart below. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--27</p>

<p><b>Initial Reaction</b></p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>2 </b></p>
<p><b>Hostile:</b> The target is openly hostile and </p>
<p>does his best to stand in the hero’s way. </p>
<p>He won’t help without an overwhelming </p>
<p>reward or payment of some kind.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>3-4 </b></p>
<p><b>Uncooperative:</b> The  target  isn’t  willing </p>
<p>to  help  unless  there’s  a  significant </p>
<p>advantage to himself.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>5-9 </b></p>
<p><b>Neutral:</b>  The  target  has  no  particular </p>
<p>attitude  and  will  help  for  little  reward </p>
<p>if the task at hand is very easy. If the </p>
<p>task is difficult, he’ll require substantial </p>
<p>payment of some kind.</p>
<p><b> 10-11 </b></p>
<p><b>Friendly:</b> The target will go out of his way </p>
<p>for the hero. He’ll likely do easy tasks </p>
<p>for free (or very little), and is willing to </p>
<p>do more dangerous tasks for fair pay or </p>
<p>other favors.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>12 </b></p>
<p><b>Helpful:</b> The target is anxious to help the </p>
<p>hero, and will probably do so for little or </p>
<p>no pay depending on the nature of the </p>
<p>task.</p>
<p>Piloting.(Agility)</p>
<p>Piloting  allows  a  character  to  fly  airplanes, </p>
<p>helicopters, jet packs, and any other flying devices </p>
<p>common to his setting and background.</p>
<p>Repair.(Smarts)</p>
<p>Repair  is  the  ability  to  fix  gadgets,  vehicles, </p>
<p>weapons, and other machines. Characters suffer </p>
<p>a –2 penalty to their rolls if they don’t have access </p>
<p>to basic tools. A raise on a Repair roll halves the </p>
<p>time required by the specific task.</p>
<p>Riding.(Agility)</p>
<p>Riding allows a hero to mount, control, and ride </p>
<p>any beast common to his setting. Players should </p>
<p>note that mounted characters use the lowest of </p>
<p>their Fighting or Riding skills when fighting from </p>
<p>horseback. Additional  rules  for  fighting  while </p>
<p>mounted can be found on page 83.</p>
<p>Shooting.(Agility)</p>
<p>Shooting covers all attempts to hit a target with </p>
<p>a ranged weapon such as a bow, pistol, or rocket </p>
<p>launcher. The basic Target Number to hit is 4 as </p>
<p>usual, though  there  are a  number of important </p>
<p>modifiers such as range that frequently come into </p>
<p>play. See Chapter Three for more details.</p>
<p>Stealth.(Agility)</p>
<p>Stealth  is  the  ability  to  both  hide  and  move </p>
<p>quietly, as well as palm objects and pick pockets. </p>
<p>In many <i>Savage Worlds</i> games, knowing exactly </p>
<p>when your hero has been spotted and when he </p>
<p>hasn’t can be critical.</p>
<p>For  a  character  to  sneak  up  on  foes  and </p>
<p>infiltrate enemy lines, start by figuring out if the </p>
<p>“guards”  the  heroes  are  sneaking  up  on  are </p>
<p>“active” or “inactive.” <i>Inactive </i>guards aren’t paying </p>
<p>particularly close attention to their surroundings. </p>
<p>The group need only score a standard success on </p>
<p>their individual Stealth rolls to avoid being seen. </p>
<p>Failing a Stealth roll in the presence of inactive </p>
<p>guards makes them active.</p>
<p><i>Active</i>  guards  make  opposed  Notice  rolls </p>
<p>against  the  sneaking  characters’  Stealth  skills. </p>
<p>Failing  a  roll  against  active  guards  means  the </p>
<p>character is spotted.</p>
<p>Apply the following modifiers to all Stealth rolls:</p>
<p>Stealth.Modifiers</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Situation </b></p>
<p><b>Modifier</b></p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>The  Last  Step: </b> Sneaking  to  within  6”  of  a </p>
<p>foe  (usually  to  get  close  enough  for  a  melee </p>
<p>attack) requires an opposed Stealth roll versus </p>
<p>the target’s Notice, whether the guard is active </p>
<p>or inactive.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Movement Rate:</b> Out of combat, each Stealth </p>
<p>roll covers moving up to five times the character’s </p>
<p>Pace. In combat, the Stealth roll covers only a </p>
<p>single round of movement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Stealth for Groups:</b> Out of combat, make only </p>
<p>one Stealth roll for each like group of characters </p>
<p>(see Group Rolls on page 71). Use the lowest </p>
<p>movement rate to determine how much ground </p>
<p>is covered. The observers also make a group roll </p>
<p>to Notice their foes. Once a combat breaks down </p>
<p>into rounds, Stealth and Notice rolls are made on </p>
<p>an individual basis.</p>
<p>Streetwise.(Smarts)</p>
<p>Streetwise  characters  are  able  to  gather </p>

<p>Survival.(Smarts)</p>
<p>Survival allows a character to find food, water, </p>
<p>or  shelter  in  hostile  environments. A  character </p>
<p>may only make one roll per day. A successful roll </p>
<p>finds sustenance for one person, a raise on the </p>
<p>roll finds food and water for five adults. Horses and </p>
<p>other large beasts count as two adults. Children, </p>
<p>camels or others with small appetites count as </p>
<p>half. Those who benefit from the roll do not have </p>
<p>to make Fatigue rolls for the day for food, water, </p>
<p>or shelter.</p>
<p>Swimming.(Agility)</p>
<p>Swimming determines if a character floats or </p>
<p>sinks in water, as well as how fast he can move </p>
<p>within it. A character’s Pace is half his Swimming </p>
<p>skill in inches per turn in normal water (round up). </p>
<p>Choppy water counts as rough terrain and halves </p>
<p>this rate. Characters may not “run” while swimming </p>
<p>for extra movement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Holding Your Breath:</b> Characters can hold </p>
<p>their breath for a number of rounds equal to 2 plus </p>
<p>their Vigor die, or half that if they weren’t prepared </p>
<p>for being submerged and didn’t have time to get </p>
<p>a good breath.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Drowning:</b> The rules for drowning are found </p>
<p>on page 100.</p>
<p>Taunt.(Smarts)</p>
<p>Taunt is a Test of Wills attack against a person’s </p>
<p>pride  through  ridicule,  cruel  jokes,  or  one-</p>
<p>upmanship. This is an opposed roll against the </p>
<p>target’s Smarts. See Tests of Will on page 86 for </p>
<p>the effects of a successful Taunt.</p>
<p>Throwing.(Agility)</p>
<p>Throwing governs all sorts of thrown weapons, </p>
<p>from hand grenades to knives, axes, and spears. </p>
<p>Throwing works just like the Shooting skill, and </p>
<p>uses all the same modifiers, including those for </p>
<p>Range. The Rate of Fire of a thrown attack is 1 per </p>
<p>hand, so a human character could throw two items </p>
<p>at once (one with each hand), suffering the usual </p>
<p>multi-action and off-hand penalties (see page 85).</p>
<p>Tracking.(Smarts)</p>
<p>Tracking allows a character to follow the tracks </p>
<p>of one or more individuals in any type of terrain. </p>
<p>Each roll generally covers following the tracks for </p>
<p>one mile, but the GM may adjust this dramatically </p>
<p>for more specific or small scale searches.</p>

<p>Hindrances</p>
<p>Hindrances  are  character  flaws  and  physical </p>
<p>handicaps  that  occasionally  make  life  a  little </p>
<p>tougher  for  your  hero.  Some  Hindrances  are </p>
<p>more or less subjective (such as Overconfident). </p>
<p>They’re there to help you roleplay your character, </p>
<p>and might even net you more Bennies since the </p>
<p>Game Master awards them for properly playing </p>
<p>your character.</p>
<p>A  character  may  take  one  Major  Hindrance </p>
<p>and up to two Minor Hindrances. You’re free to </p>
<p>take  more  if  you  think  they  fit  your  character </p>
<p>description,  but  you  don’t  get  additional  points </p>
<p>for them.</p>
<p>Design.Note.-.Roleplaying.Hindrances</p>
<p><i>Some Hindrances impose game penalties </i></p>
<p><i>and  some  only  really  matter  if  the  player </i></p>
<p><i>roleplays  them.  That’s  intentional  and  not </i></p>
<p><i>something you should worry about too much. </i></p>
<p><i>The game is designed with the assumption </i></p>
<p><i>that  all  heroes  take  their  full  complement </i></p>
<p><i>of  Hindrances  and  therefore  have  two </i></p>
<p><i>additional attribute points, Edges, skills, or a </i></p>
<p><i>combination thereof.</i></p>
<p><i>It’s certainly true that a Hindrance like Big </i></p>
<p><i>Mouth  won’t  be  worth  much  if  the  player </i></p>
<p><i>doesn’t  occasionally  roleplay  it  by  blurting </i></p>
<p><i>things  out  at  inappropriate  times.  But  the </i></p>
<p><i>Game Master can pay a little attention here, </i></p>
<p><i>too.  For  example,  in  a  fantasy  campaign, </i></p>
<p><i>players  don’t  roleplay  every  minute  their </i></p>
<p><i>characters are in a tavern. But it’s easy to </i></p>
<p><i>assume  that  while  they’re  there—whether </i></p>
<p><i>it  was  acted  out  or  not—the  Big  Mouthed </i></p>
<p><i>hero let spill their plans to raid the ancient </i></p>
<p><i>tomb on the hill. Maybe the group will find </i></p>
<p><i>another team of adventurers are there before </i></p>
<p><i>them—or  worse,  waiting  to  see  what  they </i></p>
<p><i>found when they come out.</i></p>
<p><i>Finally, Hindrances are more about helping </i></p>
<p><i>a player figure out who his character is than </i></p>
<p><i>inflicting a gameplay penalty on him. Being </i></p>
<p><i>Loyal may never really be a problem—most </i></p>
<p><i>characters are just naturally loyal to others </i></p>
<p><i>in their party. But having it on the character </i></p>
<p><i>sheet reminds the player that he’s a “good </i></p>
<p><i>guy,” at least to his friends, and will help him </i></p>
<p><i>indirectly roleplay his character and make </i></p>
<p><i>decisions within that context he might have </i></p>
<p><i>made differently if he was Mean instead.</i></p>
<p>All.Thumbs.(Minor)</p>
<p>Some  people  just  aren’t  good  with  modern </p>
<p>devices. Characters with this drawback suffer a –2 </p>
<p>penalty to the Repair skill at all times. In addition, </p>
<p>when  a  hero  uses  a  mechanical  or  electronic </p>
<p>device, a roll of 1 on his skill die (regardless of </p>
<p>his Wild Die) means the device is broken. The </p>
<p>damage usually requires a Repair roll at –2 and </p>
<p>1d6 hours to fix.</p>
<p>Anemic.(Minor)</p>
<p>An anemic character is particularly susceptible </p>
<p>to sickness, disease, environmental effects, and </p>
<p>fatigue. He subtracts 2 from all Fatigue checks </p>
<p>such as those made to resist poison and disease. </p>
<p>(See page 99 for more information on Fatigue and </p>
<p>the various hazards that lead to it.)</p>
<p>Arrogant.(Major)</p>
<p>Your hero doesn’t think he’s the best—he knows </p>
<p>he is. Whatever it is—swordsmanship, kung fu, </p>
<p>running—few compare to his skills and he flaunts it </p>
<p>every chance he gets.</p>
<p>Winning just isn’t enough for your hero. He must </p>
<p>completely dominate his opponent. Anytime there </p>
<p>is even a shadow of a doubt as to who is better, </p>
<p>he  must  humiliate  his  opponent  and  prove  he </p>
<p>can snatch victory any time he wishes. He is the </p>
<p>kind of man who disarms an opponent in a duel </p>
<p>just so he can pick the sword up and hand it back </p>
<p>with a smirk.</p>
<p>Arrogant heroes always look for the “boss” in </p>
<p>battle, attacking lesser minions only if they get </p>
<p>in the way.</p>
<p>Bad.Eyes.(Minor.or.Major)</p>
<p>Your  hero’s  eyes  just  aren’t  what  they  used </p>
<p>to be. With glasses, there’s no penalty and the </p>
<p>Hindrance  is  only  Minor.  Should  he  lose  his </p>
<p>glasses  (generally  a  50%  chance  when  he’s </p>
<p>wounded,  or  no  chance  with  a  “nerd-strap”), </p>
<p>he  suffers  a  –2  penalty  to  any Trait  roll  made </p>
<p>to shoot or Notice something more than 5” (10 </p>
<p>yards) distant.</p>
<p>In low-tech settings where the hero cannot wear </p>
<p>glasses, Bad Eyes is a Major Hindrance. He must </p>
<p>subtract 2 from Trait rolls made to attack or notice </p>
<p>things 5” or more away.</p>
<p>Bad.Luck.(Major)</p>
<p>Your hero is a little less lucky than most. He gets </p>
<p>one less Benny per game session than normal. </p>
<p>A character cannot have both Bad Luck and the </p>
<p>Luck Edge.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--30</p>
<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p>Big.Mouth.(Minor)</p>
<p>Loose  lips  sink  ships,  the  saying  goes. Your </p>
<p>hero’s mouth could drown an armada.</p>
<p>Your character can’t keep a secret very well. </p>
<p>He reveals plans and gives away things best kept </p>
<p>among friends, usually at the worst possible times.</p>
<p>Blind.(Major)</p>
<p>The individual is completely without sight. He </p>
<p>suffers a –6 to all physical tasks that require vision </p>
<p>(which is most everything) and –2 to most social </p>
<p>tasks as he can’t “read” those he’s interacting with </p>
<p>as well as others.</p>
<p>On  the  plus  side,  Blind  characters  gain  their </p>
<p>choice  of  a  free  Edge  to  compensate  for  this </p>
<p>particularly difficult Hindrance.</p>
<p>Bloodthirsty.(Major)</p>
<p>Your hero never takes prisoners unless under </p>
<p>the direct supervision of a superior. This can cause </p>
<p>major problems in a military campaign unless his </p>
<p>superiors condone that sort of thing. Your killer </p>
<p>suffers –4 to his Charisma, but only if his cruel </p>
<p>habits are known.</p>
<p>Cautious.(Minor)</p>
<p>Some folks gather too much intelligence. This </p>
<p>character  personifies  over-cautiousness.  He </p>
<p>never  makes  rash  decisions  and  likes  to  plot </p>
<p>things out in detail long before any action is taken.</p>
<p>Clueless.(Major)</p>
<p>Your hero isn’t as aware of his world as most </p>
<p>others. He suffers –2 to Common Knowledge rolls.</p>
<p>Code.of.Honor.(Major)</p>
<p>Honor is very important to your character. He </p>
<p>keeps his word, won’t abuse or kill prisoners, and </p>
<p>generally tries to operate within his world’s particular </p>
<p>notion of proper gentlemanly or ladylike behavior.</p>
<p>Curious.(Major)</p>
<p>It killed the cat, and it might kill your hero as </p>
<p>well. Curious characters are easily dragged into </p>
<p>any adventure. They have to check out everything </p>
<p>and always want to know what’s behind a potential </p>
<p>mystery.</p>
<p>Death.Wish.(Minor)</p>
<p>Having  a  death  wish  doesn’t  mean  your </p>
<p>adventurer is suicidal—but he does want to die </p>
<p><i>after</i>  completing  some  important  goal.  Maybe </p>
<p>he wants revenge  for the murder  of  his family, </p>
<p>or maybe he’s dying from disease and wants to </p>
<p>go out in a blaze of glory. He won’t throw his life </p>
<p>away for no reason, but when there’s a chance </p>
<p>to complete his goal, he’ll do anything—and take </p>
<p>any risk—to achieve it.</p>
<p>This Hindrance is usually Minor unless the goal </p>
<p>is relatively easily fulfilled (very rare).</p>
<p>Delusional.(Minor.or.Major)</p>
<p>Your hero believes something that is considered </p>
<p>quite strange by everyone else. Minor Delusions </p>
<p>are harmless or the character generally keeps it </p>
<p>to himself (the government puts sedatives in soft </p>
<p>drinks, dogs can talk, we’re all just characters in </p>
<p>some bizarre game, etc.).</p>
<p>With a Major Delusion, he expresses his view </p>
<p>on the situation frequently and it can occasionally </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--31</p>
<p>Character.Creation</p>
<p>lead to danger (the government is run by aliens, </p>
<p>hospitals are deadly, I’m allergic to armor, zombies </p>
<p>are my friends).</p>
<p>Doubting.Thomas.(Minor)</p>
<p>Some people don’t believe in the supernatural </p>
<p>until they’re halfway down some creature’s gullet. </p>
<p>Doubting Thomases are skeptics who try their best </p>
<p>to rationalize supernatural events. Even once a </p>
<p>Doubting Thomas realizes the supernatural exists, </p>
<p>he still tries to rationalize weird events, following </p>
<p>red herrings or ignoring evidence.</p>
<p>Doubting  Thomases  suffer  –2  to  their  Fear </p>
<p>checks  when  confronted  with  undeniable </p>
<p>supernatural horror.</p>
<p>Elderly.(Major)</p>
<p>Your adventurer is getting on in years, but he’s </p>
<p>not quite ready for the nursing home. His Pace </p>
<p>is reduced by 1, and his Strength and Vigor drop </p>
<p>a die type to a minimum of d4, and cannot be </p>
<p>raised thereafter.</p>
<p>On the plus side, the wisdom of his years grants </p>
<p>the hero 5 extra skill points that may be used for </p>
<p>any skills linked to Smarts.</p>
<p>Enemy.(Minor.or.Major)</p>
<p>Someone  out  there  hates  the  character  and </p>
<p>wants  him  dead.  The  value  of  the  Hindrance </p>
<p>depends on how powerful the enemy is and how </p>
<p>often he might show up. A Minor Enemy might </p>
<p>be a lone gunslinger out for vengeance. A Major </p>
<p>Enemy might be a supernatural gunslinger who </p>
<p>wants your hero dead.</p>
<p>If the enemy is one day defeated, the GM should </p>
<p>gradually work in a replacement, or the hero may </p>
<p>buy off the Hindrance by sacrificing an Advance.</p>
<p>Greedy.(Minor.or.Major)</p>
<p>Your  miserly  hero  measures  his  worth  in </p>
<p>treasure. If a Minor Hindrance, he argues bitterly </p>
<p>over  any  loot  acquired  during  play.  If  a  Major </p>
<p>Hindrance, he fights over anything he considers </p>
<p>unfair, and may even kill for his “fair share.”</p>
<p>Habit.(Minor.or.Major)</p>
<p>Your warrior has an annoying and constant habit </p>
<p>of some sort. Maybe she picks her nose, says </p>
<p>“y’know” in every sentence, or chews gum like </p>
<p>it’s going out of style.</p>
<p>A Minor Habit irritates those around her but isn’t </p>
<p>dangerous. Your hero suffers a –1 Charisma.</p>
<p>A Major Habit is a physical or mental addiction </p>
<p>of some sort that is debilitating or possibly even </p>
<p>deadly. This includes drug use, chronic drinking, </p>
<p>or  perhaps  even  an  addiction  to  virtual  reality </p>
<p>in a high-tech setting. A character who doesn’t </p>
<p>get his fix must make a Fatigue check every 24 </p>
<p>hours thereafter (see Fatigue on page 99). The </p>
<p>first failed roll makes the character Fatigued, then </p>
<p>Exhausted. The  final  result  is  a  coma  for  hard </p>
<p>drug use, or a bad case of the shakes for things </p>
<p>like alcohol or VR. Medical care may ease the </p>
<p>symptoms. Otherwise the victim must live with the </p>
<p>penalties for 1d6 days. Afterward, the hero must </p>
<p>buy off the Hindrance by sacrificing an opportunity </p>
<p>to Advance  or  he  eventually  falls  back  into  his </p>
<p>dependency.</p>
<p>Hard.of.Hearing.(Minor.or.Major)</p>
<p>Characters who have lost some or all of their </p>
<p>hearing  have  this  disadvantage. As  a  Minor </p>
<p>Hindrance, it subtracts 2 from all Notice rolls made </p>
<p>to hear, including awaking due to loud noises. A </p>
<p>Major Hindrance means the character is deaf. She </p>
<p>cannot hear and automatically fails all Notice rolls </p>
<p>that depend on hearing.</p>
<p>Heroic.(Major)</p>
<p>This noble soul never says no to a person in </p>
<p>need. She doesn’t have to be happy about it, but </p>
<p>she  always  comes  to  the  rescue  of  those  she </p>
<p>feels can’t help themselves. She’s the first one </p>
<p>to run into a burning building, usually agrees to </p>
<p>hunt monsters for little or no pay, and is generally </p>
<p>a pushover for a sob story.</p>
<p>Illiterate.(Minor)</p>
<p>Your hero cannot read. He can probably sign </p>
<p>his  name  and  knows  what  a  STOP  sign  says, </p>
<p>but can do little else. He also doesn’t know much </p>
<p>about math either. He can probably do 2+2=4, but </p>
<p>multiplication and the like are beyond him.</p>
<p>Illiterates can’t read or write in any language, by </p>
<p>the way, no matter how many they actually speak.</p>
<p>Lame.(Major)</p>
<p>A past wound has nearly crippled your hero. His </p>
<p>basic Pace is reduced by 2 and he rolls only a d4 </p>
<p>for running rolls. A character’s Pace may never </p>
<p>be reduced below 1.</p>
<p>Loyal.(Minor)</p>
<p>Your character may not be a hero, but he’d give </p>
<p>his life for his friends. This character can never </p>
<p>leave a man behind if there’s any chance at all </p>
<p>he could help.</p>
<p>Mean.(Minor)</p>
<p>This  fellow  is  ill-tempered  and  disagreeable. </p>
<p>No  one  really  likes  him,  and  he  has  trouble </p>
<p>doing  anything  kind  for  anyone  else.  He  must </p>
<p>be paid for his troubles and doesn’t even accept </p>
<p>awards graciously. Your character suffers –2 to </p>
<p>his Charisma.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--32</p>
<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p>Obese.(Minor)</p>
<p>Particularly  large  people  often  have  great </p>
<p>difficulty in dangerous physical situations. Those </p>
<p>who carry their weight well have the Brawny Edge. </p>
<p>Those who don’t handle it very well are Obese. </p>
<p>A character cannot be both Brawny and Obese.</p>
<p>An Obese hero adds 1 to his Toughness, but </p>
<p>his Pace is decreased by 1 and his running die is </p>
<p>a d4. Obese characters may also have difficulty </p>
<p>finding armor or clothing that fits, squeezing into </p>
<p>tight spaces, or even riding in confined spaces </p>
<p>such as coach airplane seats or compact cars.</p>
<p>One.Arm.(Major)</p>
<p>Whether by birth or battle, your hero has lost </p>
<p>an arm. Fortunately, his other arm is (now) his </p>
<p>“good” one. Tasks that require two hands, such </p>
<p>as Climbing, suffer a –4 modifier.</p>
<p>One.Eye.(Major)</p>
<p>Your  hero  lost  an  eye  for  some  unfortunate </p>
<p>reason. If he doesn’t wear a patch or buy a glass </p>
<p>replacement (typically $500), he suffers –1 to his </p>
<p>Charisma for the grotesque wound.</p>
<p>He  suffers  –2  to  any  Trait  rolls  that  require </p>
<p>depth perception, such as Shooting or Throwing, </p>
<p>jumping a ravine or rooftop, and so on.</p>
<p>One.Leg.(Major)</p>
<p>With  a  prosthetic,  One  Leg  acts  exactly  like </p>
<p>the  Lame  Hindrance,  reducing  Pace  by  2  and </p>
<p>running rolls are now a d4. Without a prosthetic, </p>
<p>the character’s Pace is 2 and he can never run. </p>
<p>He also suffers –2 to Traits that require mobility, </p>
<p>such as Climbing and Fighting. A character with </p>
<p>one leg also suffers a –2 penalty to his Swimming </p>
<p>skill (and Pace).</p>
<p>Outsider.(Minor)</p>
<p>In  a  society  made  up  of  only  a  few  types  of </p>
<p>people, your hero isn’t one of them. An Indian in a </p>
<p>Western town, an alien in a sci-fi game of human </p>
<p>marines, or a half-orc in a party of elves, dwarves, </p>
<p>and humans are all examples of outsiders. Locals </p>
<p>are likely to raise prices on the Outsider, ignore </p>
<p>pleas for help, and generally treat him as if he’s of </p>
<p>a lower class than the rest of their society.</p>
<p>In addition to the roleplaying effects above, your </p>
<p>hero’s Charisma suffers a –2 modifier among all </p>
<p>but his own people.</p>
<p>Overconfident.(Major)</p>
<p>There’s nothing out there your hero can’t defeat. </p>
<p>At least that’s what he thinks. He believes he can </p>
<p>do most anything and never wants to retreat from a </p>
<p>challenge. He’s not suicidal, but he certainly takes </p>
<p>on more than common sense dictates.</p>
<p>Pacifist.(Minor.or.Major)</p>
<p>Your hero absolutely despises violence. Minor </p>
<p>pacifism means he only fights when given no other </p>
<p>choice, and never allows the killing of prisoners </p>
<p>or other defenseless victims.</p>
<p>Major Pacifists won’t fight living characters under </p>
<p><i>any</i> circumstances. They may defend themselves, </p>
<p>but  won’t  do  anything  to  permanently  harm </p>
<p>sentient,  living  creatures.  Note  that  undeniably </p>
<p>evil creatures, undead, demons, and the like are </p>
<p>fair game. A Major Pacifist might also fight with </p>
<p>nonlethal methods, such as with his fists. Such </p>
<p>characters only do so when obviously threatened, </p>
<p>however.</p>
<p>Phobia.(Minor.or.Major)</p>
<p>Phobias  are  overwhelming  and  irrational </p>
<p>fears that stay with a hero for the rest of his life. </p>
<p>Whenever a character is in the presence of his </p>
<p>phobia, he subtracts 2 from all his Trait tests as </p>
<p>a Minor Hindrance, and 4 if the fear is a Major </p>
<p>Phobia.</p>
<p>Phobias  shouldn’t  be  too  obvious—everyone </p>
<p>should be afraid of vampires, for example, so it’s </p>
<p>not a phobia—it’s common sense. Instead, the </p>
<p>phobia usually centers on some random element </p>
<p>the mind focused on during whatever encounter </p>
<p>caused  such  a  fright.  Remember,  phobias  are </p>
<p><i>irrational</i> fears.</p>
<p>Poverty.(Minor)</p>
<p>It’s said a fool and his money are soon parted. </p>
<p>Your hero is that fool. He starts with half the usual </p>
<p>money for your setting and just can’t seem to hang </p>
<p>onto funds acquired after play begins. In general, </p>
<p>the player halves his total funds every game week.</p>
<p>Quirk.(Minor)</p>
<p>Your hero has some minor foible that is usually </p>
<p>humorous,  but  can  occasionally  cause  him </p>
<p>trouble. A swashbuckler may always try to first </p>
<p>slash his initials on his foes before attacking, a </p>
<p>dwarf may brag constantly about his culture, or a </p>
<p>snobby debutante might not eat, drink, or socialize </p>
<p>with the lower class.</p>
<p>Small.(Major)</p>
<p>Your character is either very skinny, very short, </p>
<p>or both relative to his particular race. Subtract 1 </p>
<p>from his Toughness for his reduced stature.</p>
<p>Stubborn.(Minor)</p>
<p>This stubborn individual always wants his way </p>
<p>and  never  admits  he’s  wrong.  Even  when  it’s </p>
<p>painfully obvious he’s made a mistake he tries to </p>
<p>justify it with half-truths and rationalizations.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>

<p>Character.Creation</p>
<p>Ugly.(Minor)</p>
<p>Unfortunately,  this  individual  hit  more  than  a </p>
<p>few ugly sticks on his way down the tree of life. </p>
<p>His Charisma is lowered by 2, and he is generally </p>
<p>shunned by members of the opposite sex.</p>
<p>Vengeful.(Minor.or.Major)</p>
<p>Your  character  always  attempts  to  right  a </p>
<p>wrong he feels was done to him. If this is a Minor </p>
<p>Hindrance, he usually seeks vengeance legally. </p>
<p>The type and immediacy of his vengeance varies </p>
<p>by character, of course. Some plot and scheme for </p>
<p>months to extract what they see as justice. Others </p>
<p>demand immediate results.</p>
<p>If this is a Major Hindrance, your character will </p>
<p>kill to rectify his perceived injustice.</p>
<p>Vow.(Minor.or.Major)</p>
<p>The character has a vow of some sort. Whether </p>
<p>it’s  Major  or  Minor  depends  on  the  Vow  itself. </p>
<p>Some  may  have  Vows  to  particular  orders  or </p>
<p>causes, to the Hippocratic Oath, to rid the world </p>
<p>of evil, and so on. The danger in fulfilling the Vow </p>
<p>and how often it might occur determines the level </p>
<p>of the Hindrance. Whatever the Vow, it’s only a </p>
<p>Hindrance if it actually comes into play from time </p>
<p>to time and causes the character some discomfort.</p>
<p>Wanted.(Minor.or.Major)</p>
<p>Your  hero  has  committed  some  crime  in  his </p>
<p>past  and  will  be  arrested  if  discovered  by  the </p>
<p>authorities. This assumes the setting actually has </p>
<p>laws and police officers to enforce them.</p>
<p> The level of the Hindrance depends on how </p>
<p>serious  the  crime  was. A  hero  with  numerous </p>
<p>unpaid parking tickets (in a game where he might </p>
<p>have to drive occasionally) has a Minor Hindrance, </p>
<p>as  does  someone  wanted  for  more  serious </p>
<p>crimes away from the main campaign area. Being </p>
<p>accused of murder is a Major Hindrance in almost </p>
<p>any setting.</p>
<p>Yellow.(Major)</p>
<p>Not everyone has ice water in his veins. Your </p>
<p>hero is squeamish at the sight of blood and gore </p>
<p>and terrified of coming to harm. He subtracts 2 </p>
<p>from all of his fear-based Spirit checks.</p>
<p>Young.(Major)</p>
<p>Children  are  sometimes  forced  to  go  on </p>
<p>dangerous  adventures  through  unfortunate </p>
<p>circumstances. Think  carefully  before  choosing </p>
<p>this  Hindrance,  for  your  youngster  starts  at  a </p>
<p>significant disadvantage.</p>
<p>Young heroes are generally 8–12 years old (in </p>
<p>human years—adjust this for races with different </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--34</p>
<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p>aging  paradigms). They  have  only  3  points  to </p>
<p>adjust their attributes and 10 skill points. On the </p>
<p>plus side, youths like these have a fair amount of </p>
<p>luck. They draw one extra Benny at the beginning </p>
<p>of each game session in addition to any additional </p>
<p>Bennies gained from such things as the Luck or </p>
<p>Great Luck Edges.</p>
<p>If  the  character  should  live  long  enough  to </p>
<p>mature, the Hindrance doesn’t have to be bought </p>
<p>off, he’s already paid the price for the Hindrance </p>
<p>by starting at a disadvantage. He stops getting </p>
<p>the  extra  Benny  when  he  reaches  18  years  of </p>
<p>age  however  (or  the  age  of  adulthood  in  your </p>
<p>particular setting).</p>
<p>Edges</p>
<p>Below  is  a  list  of  Edges  common  to  most </p>
<p>settings. You’ll find more Edges in official <i>Savage </i></p>
<p><i>Worlds</i>  setting  books  as  well. The  Edges  are </p>
<p>grouped by type to help during character creation. </p>
<p>Unless an Edge specifically says otherwise, it may </p>
<p>only be selected once.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b>  Below  each  Edge  are  any </p>
<p>skills  and  Rank  required  to  take  it. A  Novice </p>
<p>character  can’t  buy  a  Legendary  Edge,  for </p>
<p>instance. A character may always purchase an </p>
<p>Edge of a Rank lower than his.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Improved Edges: </b>Some Edges have improved </p>
<p>effects if you purchase additional “levels” in them, </p>
<p>such  as Attractive  and  Very Attractive,  or  Rich </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--35</p>
<p>Character.Creation</p>
<p>and Filthy Rich. To buy an Improved Edge, you </p>
<p>must have all previous versions of an Edge. You </p>
<p>must choose Rich before buying Filthy Rich, for </p>
<p>example.</p>
<p>Background.Edges</p>
<p>These  Edges  are  hereditary  and  background </p>
<p>advantages or learned responses that develop in </p>
<p>a character after prolonged training or exposure </p>
<p>to certain events.</p>
<p>Players can choose these Edges after character </p>
<p>creation but the Game Master might require a little </p>
<p>more rationalization. An individual might choose </p>
<p>the Attractive  Edge,  for  example,  by  cleaning </p>
<p>herself  up,  getting  a  makeover,  and  generally </p>
<p>paying more attention to her looks. Characters </p>
<p>might  be  able  to  gain  the Arcane  Background </p>
<p>Edge as well, should they find a book of forbidden </p>
<p>knowledge or train under another arcane type in </p>
<p>their party. </p>
<p>Design.Note.-.Background.Edges</p>
<p><i>In  previous  versions  of </i> Savage  Worlds,<i> </i></p>
<p><i>Background  Edges  could  only  be  taken  at </i></p>
<p><i>character creation without special permission </i></p>
<p><i>by the Game Master. We’ve changed that rule </i></p>
<p><i>and you may now take Background Edges as </i></p>
<p><i>advances just like any other. If you care about </i></p>
<p><i>the rationalization of such things, you may </i></p>
<p><i>want to link them to an event in your game. </i></p>
<p><i>If a player wants the Fast Healer Edge, for </i></p>
<p><i>example, you might say (or the Game Master </i></p>
<p><i>might require) that  exposure to the party’s </i></p>
<p><i>magical healing, or a new emphasis on health </i></p>
<p><i>and fitness, have given the hero this ability. </i></p>
<p>Alertness</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Novice</p>
<p>Not much gets by your hero. He’s very observant </p>
<p>and perceptive, and adds +2 to his Notice rolls to </p>
<p>hear, see, or otherwise sense the world around him.</p>
<p>Ambidextrous</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Novice, Agility d8+</p>
<p>Your hero is as deft with his left hand as he is </p>
<p>with  his  right.  Characters  normally  suffer  a  –2 </p>
<p>penalty when performing physical tasks with the </p>
<p>off-hand  (characters  are  assumed  to  be  right-</p>
<p>handed). With this Edge, your warrior ignores the </p>
<p>–2 penalty for using his off-hand (see page 85).</p>
<p>Arcane.Background</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Novice, Special</p>
<p>This is the Edge your character must purchase </p>
<p>to  have  any  sort  of  magical,  psionic,  or  other </p>
<p>supernatural  ability.  See  Chapter  Five  for  a </p>
<p>complete description of Arcane Backgrounds.</p>
<p>Arcane.Resistance</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Novice, Spirit d8+</p>
<p>This individual is particularly resistant to magic </p>
<p>(including psionics, weird science, etc.), whether </p>
<p>by nature or by heritage. He acts as if he had </p>
<p>2 points of Armor when hit by damage-causing </p>
<p>arcane powers, and adds +2 to his Trait rolls when </p>
<p>resisting opposed powers. Even friendly arcane </p>
<p>powers must subtract this modifier to affect the </p>
<p>resistant hero.</p>
<p>Improved.Arcane.Resistance</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Novice, Arcane Resistance</p>
<p> As above but Armor and resistance are </p>
<p>increased to 4.</p>
<p>Attractive</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Novice, Vigor d6+</p>
<p>It’s  no  secret  that  beautiful  people  have  an </p>
<p>easier  time  getting  their  way  in  life. This  Edge </p>
<p>grants your beautiful or handsome character +2 </p>
<p>to Charisma.</p>
<p>Very.Attractive</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Novice, Attractive</p>
<p>Your  hero  is  drop-dead  gorgeous.  His </p>
<p>Charisma is increased to +4.</p>
<p>Berserk</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Novice</p>
<p>Immediately after suffering a wound (including a </p>
<p>Shaken result from physical damage), your hero </p>
<p>must make a Smarts roll or go Berserk.</p>
<p>While Berserk, his Parry is reduced by 2 but he </p>
<p>adds +2 to all Fighting, Strength, melee damage </p>
<p>rolls,  and  Toughness.  The  warrior  ignores  all </p>
<p>wound modifiers while Berserk, but cannot use </p>
<p>any  skills,  Edges,  or  maneuvers  that  require </p>
<p>concentration, including Shooting and Taunt, but </p>
<p>not Intimidation.</p>
<p>Berserkers  attack  with  reckless  abandon. </p>
<p>Anytime his Fighting die is a 1 (regardless of his </p>
<p>Wild Die), he hits a random adjacent target (not </p>
<p>the original target). The attack may hit friend as </p>
<p>well as foe. If there are no other adjacent targets, </p>
<p>the blow simply misses.</p>
<p>The  Berserker  may  end  his  rage  by  doing </p>
<p>nothing (not even moving) for one full action and </p>
<p>making a Smarts roll at –2.</p>
<p>Brave</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Novice, Spirit d6+</p>
<p>Those with this Edge have learned to master </p>
<p>their fear. Or perhaps are so jaded or emotionally </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--36</p>
<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p>distant they’ve just lost their normal “fight or flight” </p>
<p>responses. Either way, your hero adds +2 to Fear </p>
<p>tests. If the character is in a setting that uses Guts </p>
<p>as a Setting Rule, it adds to that as well.</p>
<p>Brawny</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b>  Novice,  Strength  and </p>
<p>Vigor d6+</p>
<p>Your bruiser is very large or perhaps just very </p>
<p>fit.  His  bulk  resists  damage  better  than  most </p>
<p>and adds +1 to his Toughness. In addition, the </p>
<p>character can carry more than most proportional </p>
<p>to his Strength. He can carry 8 times his Strength </p>
<p>in pounds without penalty instead of the usual 5 </p>
<p>times his Strength.</p>
<p>Fast.Healer</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Novice, Vigor d8+</p>
<p>Some individuals just seem to heal faster than </p>
<p>others. Those with this blessing add +2 to Vigor </p>
<p>rolls when checking for natural healing. See page </p>
<p>87 for complete rules on Healing.</p>
<p>Fleet-Footed</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Novice, Agility d6+</p>
<p>The hero’s Pace is increased by +2 and he </p>
<p>rolls a d10 instead of a d6 when running. </p>
<p>Linguist</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Novice, Smarts d6+</p>
<p>The character has an ear for languages and a </p>
<p>rare  talent  for  recognizing  similarities  between </p>
<p>them. A  character  with  this  Edge  starts  with  a </p>
<p>number  of  languages  equal  to  his  Smarts  die, </p>
<p>and can make a Smarts roll at –2 to make herself </p>
<p>understood in any language or dialect she has </p>
<p>heard spoken for at least a week.</p>
<p>Luck</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Novice</p>
<p>The adventurer seems to be blessed by fate, </p>
<p>karma, the gods, or whatever external forces he </p>
<p>believes in (or believe in him!)</p>
<p>He draws one extra Benny at the beginning of </p>
<p>each game session, allowing him to succeed at </p>
<p>important tasks more often than most, and survive </p>
<p>incredible dangers.</p>
<p>Great.Luck.</p>
<p><b>Requirements: </b>Novice, Luck</p>
<p>The  player  draws  two  extra  Bennies </p>
<p>instead of one at the start of each session.</p>
<p>Noble</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Novice</p>
<p>Those born of noble blood have many perks in </p>
<p>life, but often have just as many responsibilities. </p>
<p>Nobles  have  high  status  in  their  societies,  are </p>
<p>entitled to special treatment from their foes, gain </p>
<p>+2 Charisma, and also have the Rich Edge. This </p>
<p>gives  the  hero  several  Edges  for  the  price  of </p>
<p>one, but the responsibilities more than offset the </p>
<p>additional perks. Nobles often have troops under </p>
<p>their control, as well as land, a family home, and </p>
<p>other assets. All of this must be determined by the </p>
<p>GM, and balanced by the grave responsibilities </p>
<p>the character faces. </p>
<p>As  an  example,  a  character  in  a  fantasy </p>
<p>campaign might have a company of swordsmen, a </p>
<p>small keep, and even a magical sword he inherited </p>
<p>from his father. But he also has an entire region </p>
<p>to manage, criminals to judge, justice to mete out, </p>
<p>and a jealous neighbor who covets his lands and </p>
<p>constantly plots against him at court.</p>
<p>Quick</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Novice, Agility d8+</p>
<p>Quick  characters  have  lightning-fast  reflexes </p>
<p>and a cool head. Whenever you are dealt a 5 or </p>
<p>lower in combat, you may discard and draw again </p>
<p>until you get a card higher than 5.</p>
<p>Characters  with  both  the  Level  Headed  and </p>
<p>Quick Edges draw their additional card and take </p>
<p>the best as usual. If that card is a Five or less, the </p>
<p>Quick Edge may be used to draw a replacement </p>
<p>until it’s Six or higher.</p>
<p>Rich</p>
<p><b>Requirements: </b>Novice</p>
<p>Whether the individual was born with a silver </p>
<p>spoon in his mouth or earned it through hard work, </p>
<p>he’s  got  more  money  than  most.  Rich  heroes </p>
<p>start with three times the normal starting funds </p>
<p>for the setting. If a regular income is appropriate </p>
<p>for this setting, the hero receives the modern day </p>
<p>equivalent of a $150,000 annual salary.</p>
<p>Filthy.Rich</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Novice, Rich or Noble</p>
<p>This character is very wealthy. He has five </p>
<p>times the starting funds for the setting and, </p>
<p>if  appropriate,  a  yearly  income  of  around </p>
<p>$500,000.</p>
<p>Wealthier characters should have a very </p>
<p>complete background as well. This needs </p>
<p>to be worked out with the GM, and comes </p>
<p>with many more assets as well as onerous </p>
<p>responsibilities.</p>
<p>Combat.Edges</p>
<p>These Edges are designed to help your hero </p>
<p>dish  out  terrible  damage—or  survive  it—in  the </p>
<p>bloody battles of <i>Savage Worlds.</i></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--37</p>
<p>Character.Creation</p>
<p>Block</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Seasoned, Fighting d8+</p>
<p>Warriors who engage in frequent hand-to-hand </p>
<p>combat are far more skilled in personal defense </p>
<p>than most others. They’ve learned not only how to </p>
<p>attack, but how to block their opponent’s blows as </p>
<p>well. A fighter with this Edge adds +1 to his Parry.</p>
<p>Improved.Block</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Veteran, Block</p>
<p>As  above,  but  the  hero  adds  +2  to  his </p>
<p>Parry.</p>
<p>Brawler</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Novice, Str d8+</p>
<p>Frequent fights with his bare hands have </p>
<p>given this thug a powerful punch. When he </p>
<p>hits  a  foe  with  a  successful  bare-handed </p>
<p>Fighting roll, he adds +2 to his damage.</p>
<p>Bruiser</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Seasoned, Brawler</p>
<p>When the bruiser gets a raise on his bare-</p>
<p>handed Fighting attack, he rolls a d8 instead </p>
<p>of a d6.</p>
<p>Combat.Reflexes</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Seasoned</p>
<p>Your  adventurer  recovers  quickly  from  shock </p>
<p>and trauma. He adds +2 to his Spirit roll when </p>
<p>attempting to recover from being Shaken.</p>
<p>Counterattack</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Seasoned, Fighting d8+</p>
<p>Fighters with this Edge know how to respond </p>
<p>instantly to an enemy’s mistakes. Once per round </p>
<p>(if not Shaken), the character receives one free </p>
<p>Fighting  attack  against  one  adjacent  foe  who </p>
<p>failed a Fighting attack against him. This attack </p>
<p>is made at –2, and the Counterattack must be a </p>
<p>normal attack (no Disarm, Wild Attack, or other </p>
<p>maneuvers),  and  may  not  be  combined  with </p>
<p>Frenzy or Sweep. It may be used with the Defend </p>
<p>maneuver, but not Full Defense.</p>
<p>Improved.Counterattack</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Veteran, Counterattack</p>
<p>As  above  but  the  character  may  ignore </p>
<p>the –2 penalty.</p>
<p>Dodge</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Seasoned, Agility d8+</p>
<p>Some  crafty  types  know  how  to  get  out  of </p>
<p>harm’s way. This Edge allows them to use cover, </p>
<p>movement, and concealment to make them harder </p>
<p>to  hit.  Unless  they  are  the  victim  of  a  surprise </p>
<p>attack and taken completely unaware, attackers </p>
<p>must subtract 1 from their ranged attack rolls when </p>
<p>targeting them (even in close combat).</p>
<p>Characters who attempt to evade area effect </p>
<p>attacks  may  add  +1  to  their Agility  roll  as  well </p>
<p>(when allowed).</p>
<p>Improved.Dodge</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Veteran, Dodge</p>
<p>As  above  but  attackers  subtract  2  from </p>
<p>their attack rolls, and the character adds +2 </p>
<p>to evade area effect weapons when allowed.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--38</p>
<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p>Elan</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Novice, Spirit d8+</p>
<p>When  this  spirited  hero  puts  his  heart  into </p>
<p>something it tends to pay off in big ways. When </p>
<p>you spend a Benny on a Trait roll (including Soak </p>
<p>rolls), add +2 to the final total.</p>
<p>Extraction</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Novice, Agility d8+</p>
<p>When  a  character  normally  withdraws  from </p>
<p>a  melee,  his  attacker  gets  a  free  attack  before </p>
<p>he  does  so—a  very  dangerous  proposition  for </p>
<p>most. Your  hero  is  adept  at  retreating  from  an </p>
<p>engagement.</p>
<p>Make an Agility roll. If successful, one opponent </p>
<p>doesn’t get a free attack anytime you disengage </p>
<p>(see page 87).</p>
<p>Improved.Extraction</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Novice, Extraction</p>
<p>As above but if you succeed with a raise </p>
<p>all  opponents  currently  in  melee  with  the </p>
<p>character  lose  their  free  attack  as  your </p>
<p>warrior withdraws.</p>
<p>First.Strike</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Novice, Agility d8+</p>
<p>Once per turn the hero (if not Shaken) gets a free </p>
<p>Fighting attack against a single foe who moves </p>
<p>adjacent to him. This automatically interrupts the </p>
<p>opponent’s action and does not cost the hero his </p>
<p>action if he is on Hold or has not yet acted this </p>
<p>round.</p>
<p>Improved.First.Strike</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Heroic, First </p>
<p>Strike</p>
<p>As  above  but  the  hero </p>
<p>may  make  one  free </p>
<p>attack  against  each </p>
<p>and  every  foe  who </p>
<p>moves  adjacent  to </p>
<p>him.</p>
<p>Florentine</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> </p>
<p>Novice, Agility  d8+, </p>
<p>Fighting d8+</p>
<p>A  character  trained  to  fight </p>
<p>“Florentine” is a master at </p>
<p>wielding  two  weapons  at </p>
<p>once. He adds +1 to his </p>
<p>Fighting  rolls  versus  an </p>
<p>opponent  with  a  single </p>
<p>weapon  and  no  shield.  In </p>
<p>addition, opponents subtract </p>
<p>1 from any “gang up” bonuses they would normally </p>
<p>get against the fighter as his two flashing blades </p>
<p>parry their blows.</p>
<p>Frenzy</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Seasoned, Fighting d10+</p>
<p>Frenzied fighters make fast and furious melee </p>
<p>attacks,  sacrificing  finesse  for  raw  speed. This </p>
<p>allows  them  to  make  an  extra  Fighting  attack </p>
<p>per  round  at  a  –2  penalty  to  all  Fighting  rolls. </p>
<p>This attack must be taken at the same time as </p>
<p>another Fighting attack though it may target any </p>
<p>two foes adjacent to the hero (Wild Cards roll two </p>
<p>Fighting dice and one Wild Die). The –2 penalty </p>
<p>is subtracted from all attacks. </p>
<p>A character armed with two weapons still only </p>
<p>makes one extra attack.</p>
<p>Improved.Frenzy</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Veteran, Frenzy</p>
<p>As above but the character may ignore the </p>
<p>–2 Frenzy penalty.</p>
<p>Giant.Killer</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Veteran</p>
<p>The bigger they are, the harder they are to kill. </p>
<p>At least for most. But your hero knows how to find </p>
<p>the weak points in massive creatures.</p>
<p>Your hero does +1d6 damage when attacking </p>
<p>creatures three sizes or more larger </p>
<p>than  himself. An  ogre  (Size  +3) </p>
<p>with  this  ability,  for  example, </p>
<p>gains the bonus only against </p>
<p>creatures  of  Size  +6  or </p>
<p>greater. A human Giant Killer </p>
<p>(Size  0),  can  claim  the </p>
<p>bonus  against  the  ogre, </p>
<p>however.</p>
<p>Hard.to.Kill</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> </p>
<p>Wild Card, Novice, </p>
<p>Spirit d8+</p>
<p>This adventurer has more </p>
<p>lives than a truckload of cats. </p>
<p>When forced to make Vigor </p>
<p>rolls due to Incapacitation, </p>
<p>he may ignore his wound </p>
<p>modifiers.  This  only </p>
<p>applies to Vigor rolls called </p>
<p>for to resist Incapacitation </p>
<p>or  death  (see  page  77).  He </p>
<p>still suffers from wound modifiers </p>
<p>for other Trait rolls normally.</p>

<p>Character.Creation</p>
<p>Harder.to.Kill</p>

<p>Your hero is tougher to kill than Rasputin. </p>
<p>If he is ever “killed,” roll a die. On an odd </p>
<p>result, he’s dead as usual. On an even roll, </p>
<p>he’s  Incapacitated  but  somehow  escapes </p>
<p>death. He may be captured, stripped of all </p>
<p>his belongings, or mistakenly left for dead, </p>
<p>but he somehow survives.</p>
<p>Improvisational.Fighter</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Seasoned, Smarts d6+ </p>
<p>Heroes  often  find  themselves  fighting </p>
<p>with pieces of equipment or furnishings not </p>
<p>designed for combat. A character with this </p>
<p>Edge has a knack for using such improvised </p>
<p>weapons, and does not suffer the usual –1 </p>
<p>penalty to attack and Parry when wielding </p>
<p>them. See page 83 for details.</p>
<p>Killer.Instinct</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Heroic</p>
<p>This hero hates losing. If he ties on an opposed </p>
<p>roll of any sort, he wins. In addition, if his skill die </p>
<p>on an opposed skill roll is a 1, he can reroll it (but </p>
<p>must keep the second result, even if it’s another 1).</p>
<p>Level.Headed</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Seasoned, Smarts d8+</p>
<p>Fighters who can keep their cool when everyone </p>
<p>else is running for cover are deadly customers </p>
<p>in combat.</p>
<p>A hero with this Edge draws an additional Action </p>
<p>Card in combat and acts on the best of the draw.</p>
<p>Improved.Level.Headed</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Seasoned, Level Headed</p>
<p>As above but the hero draws 3 cards.</p>
<p>Marksman</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Seasoned</p>
<p>The hero excels at taking controlled, measured </p>
<p>shots. If he does not move in a turn, he may fire </p>
<p>as if he took the Aim maneuver. Marksman may </p>
<p>never be used with a Rate of Fire greater than 1. </p>
<p>Marksman  works  with  both  Shooting  and </p>
<p>Throwing.</p>
<p>Martial.Artist</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Novice, Fighting d6+</p>
<p>This character is highly trained in hand-to-hand </p>
<p>fighting.  He  is  never  considered  unarmed  in </p>
<p>combat and so is never subject to the Unarmed </p>
<p>Defender  rule  (page  87).  With  a  successful </p>
<p>unarmed attack, he adds +d4 to his Strength roll </p>
<p>(as if he were using a small weapon).</p>
<p>Improved.Martial.Artist</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b>  Veteran,  Martial Arts, </p>
<p>Fighting d10+</p>
<p>The character now adds +d6 to his bare-</p>
<p>handed damage.</p>
<p>Nerves.of.Steel</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b>  Wild  Card,  Novice,  Vigor </p>
<p>d8+</p>
<p>Your hero has learned to fight on through the </p>
<p>most intense pain. He may ignore 1 point of wound </p>
<p>penalties.</p>
<p>Improved.Nerves.of.Steel</p>
<p><b>Requirements: </b>Novice, Nerves of Steel</p>
<p>The  hero  ignores  2  points  of  wound </p>
<p>penalties.</p>
<p>No.Mercy</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Seasoned</p>
<p>The character may spend a Benny to reroll any </p>
<p>one  damage  roll,  including  those  made  for  area </p>
<p>effect attacks.</p>
<p>Quick.Draw</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Novice, Agility d8+</p>
<p>This  Edge  allows  a  hero  to  draw  a  weapon </p>
<p>as  a  free action (and thus  ignore  the usual –2 </p>
<p>multi-action penalty if he chooses to fire as well). </p>
<p>If the character must make an Agility roll to draw </p>
<p>a weapon (see page 74), he adds +2 to the roll.</p>
<p>Rock.and.Roll!</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Seasoned, Shooting d8+</p>
<p>Some veteran shooters learn to compensate for </p>
<p>the recoil of fully automatic weapons. If a character </p>
<p>with this Edge does not move, he may ignore the </p>
<p>recoil penalty for firing a weapon on full automatic.</p>
<p>Steady.Hands</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Novice, Agility d8+</p>
<p>Your  hero  ignores  the  “unstable  platform” </p>
<p>penalty  for  firing  from  the  backs  of  animals  or </p>
<p>while riding in moving vehicles. In addition, when </p>
<p>performing actions while Running (see page 74), </p>
<p>his penalty is –1 instead of –2.</p>
<p>Sweep</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b>  Novice,  Strength  d8+, </p>
<p>Fighting d8+</p>
<p>Sweep  allows  a  character  to  make  a  single </p>
<p>Fighting attack and apply it against all currently </p>
<p>adjacent  targets  at  a  –2  penalty  (friends  and </p>
<p>foes  alike—be  careful).  Resolve  each  damage </p>
<p>roll separately. The attack is applied immediately </p>
<p>when rolled and only affects targets adjacent at </p>
<p>that time.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--40</p>
<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p>A character may not use Sweep in the same </p>
<p>round she uses Frenzy, nor may she Sweep more </p>
<p>than once per round, or with a second weapon </p>
<p>held  in  another  hand.  In  effect,  the  hero  may </p>
<p>only perform Sweep once per action unless she </p>
<p>somehow gets two entire actions (perhaps under </p>
<p>the effects of a spell or power, for example). </p>
<p>Improved.Sweep</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Veteran, Sweep</p>
<p>As above but the hero may ignore the –2 </p>
<p>penalty.</p>
<p>Trademark.Weapon</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b>  Novice,  Fighting  or </p>
<p>Shooting of d10+</p>
<p>The hero knows one unique weapon (<i>Excalibur, </i></p>
<p><i>Old Betsy, Sting</i>) like the back of his hand. When </p>
<p>using that weapon, he adds +1 to his Fighting, </p>
<p>Shooting, or Throwing rolls. A hero can take this </p>
<p>Edge  multiple  times,  applying  it  to  a  different </p>
<p>weapon each time. If a Trademark Weapon is lost, </p>
<p>the hero can replace it, but the benefit of the Edge </p>
<p>doesn’t kick in for two game weeks.</p>
<p>Improved.Trademark.Weapon</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b>  Veteran,  Trademark </p>
<p>Weapon</p>
<p>As above but the bonus when using the </p>
<p>weapon increases to +2.</p>
<p>Two-Fisted</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Novice, Agility d8+</p>
<p>A  Two-Fisted  hero  isn’t  ambidextrous—he’s </p>
<p>simply learned to fight with two weapons (or both </p>
<p>fists) at once. When attacking with a weapon in </p>
<p>each hand, he rolls each attack separately but </p>
<p>ignores the multi-action penalty (see page 75).</p>
<p>Leadership.Edges</p>
<p>Leadership  Edges  grant  bonuses  to </p>
<p>subordinates,  making  them  more  effective, </p>
<p>reliable, or durable. These Edges apply only to a </p>
<p>number of subordinates within 5” (the “command </p>
<p>radius”), and are not cumulative with the same </p>
<p>Edge  from  other  leaders.  Subordinates  may </p>
<p>benefit from  different  Leadership Edges by the </p>
<p>same or different leaders.</p>
<p>Command</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Novice, Smarts d6+</p>
<p>Command is the ability to give clear instructions </p>
<p>to  surrounding  allies  and  enforce  your  hero’s </p>
<p>will  upon  them.  This  makes  your  character’s </p>
<p>compatriots more willing to fight on despite their </p>
<p>wounds,  and  so  adds  +1  to  their  Spirit  rolls  to </p>
<p>recover from being Shaken.</p>
<p>Command.Presence</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Novice, Command</p>
<p>A booming voice, effective commands, natural </p>
<p>charisma,  or  simple  training  results  in  a  much </p>
<p>more effective combat element. At the center of </p>
<p>that element is the officer in command. A hero with </p>
<p>this Edge has a “command radius” of 10” instead </p>
<p>of the usual 5”.</p>
<p>Fervor</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b>  Veteran,  Command, </p>
<p>Spirit d8+</p>
<p>A simple phrase uttered by a great leader can </p>
<p>sometimes have momentous results. A leader with </p>
<p>this ability can inspire his men to bloody fervor </p>
<p>by yelling a motto, slogan, or other inspirational </p>
<p>words. Those in the command radius add +1 to </p>
<p>their Fighting damage rolls.</p>
<p>Hold.the.Line!</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b>  Seasoned,  Command, </p>
<p>Smarts d8+</p>
<p>This Edge strengthens the will of the men under </p>
<p>the hero’s command. The troops add +1 to their </p>
<p>Toughness.</p>
<p>Inspire</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Seasoned, Command</p>
<p>Leaders  with  exceptional  reputations  and </p>
<p>experience in battle inspire the soldiers around </p>
<p>them. They add +2 to Spirit rolls when recovering </p>
<p>from being Shaken (this includes the original +1 </p>
<p>bonus for the Command Edge).</p>
<p>Leader.of.Men</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Veteran, Command</p>
<p>Command  comes  easy  to  this  commander. </p>
<p>Those under his command work like a well-oiled </p>
<p>machine when he’s in charge.</p>
<p>Allies under the leader’s command roll a d10 </p>
<p>as  the  Wild  Die  instead  of  a  d6  when  making </p>
<p>group rolls.</p>
<p>Natural.Leader</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Novice, Command, Spirit </p>
<p>d8+</p>
<p>This  Edge  signifies  a  special  link  between  a </p>
<p>leader  and  his  men.  With  it,  he  may  share  his </p>
<p>Bennies with any troops under his command. </p>
<p>Tactician</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b>  Seasoned,  Command, </p>
<p>Wild Card, Smarts d8+, Knowledge (Battle) </p>
<p>d6+</p>
<p>The  leader  has  a  natural  grasp  of  small  unit </p>
<p>tactics and can frequently take advantage of a </p>
<p>rapidly changing situation.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--41</p>
<p>Character.Creation</p>
<p>At  the  beginning  of  a  fight  and  before  any </p>
<p>Action  Cards  are  dealt,  the  hero  makes  a </p>
<p>Knowledge  (Battle)  roll.  For  each  success  and </p>
<p>raise  he  receives  one Action  Card. These  are </p>
<p>kept separate from his regular Action Cards and </p>
<p>are not placed back into the deck until used or </p>
<p>the combat ends (including Jokers!). At the start </p>
<p>of any round, the hero may give one or more of </p>
<p>these extra cards to his allies, whether Extras or </p>
<p>Wild Cards, who then use it as their Action Card </p>
<p>for the round in place of the one dealt them. This </p>
<p>allows Extras to operate independently of Wild </p>
<p>Card  characters  for  one  round  if  they  receive </p>
<p>their own card.</p>
<p>Only  one  character  per  encounter  may  use </p>
<p>this Edge.</p>
<p>Power.Edges</p>
<p>Power  Edges  are  for  those  with  Arcane </p>
<p>Backgrounds.  See  Chapter  Five  for  more </p>
<p>information on each type of Arcane Background, </p>
<p>how to use them, and the powers available.</p>
<p>New.Power</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Novice, Arcane Background</p>
<p>An arcane character may learn a new power </p>
<p>by  choosing  this  Edge  (which  may  be  taken </p>
<p>multiple times). He may choose from any powers </p>
<p>normally available to his particular Arcane </p>
<p>Background.</p>
<p>Power.Points</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b>  Novice, Arcane </p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Wizards, weird scientists, and other </p>
<p>arcane  types  always  want  more </p>
<p>power. This Edge grants them an </p>
<p>additional 5 Power Points.</p>
<p>Power  Points  may  be  selected </p>
<p>more  than  once,  but  only  once  per </p>
<p>Rank.</p>
<p>Rapid.Recharge</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Seasoned, Spirit d6+, </p>
<p>Arcane Background</p>
<p>This  Edge  allows  an  arcane  character </p>
<p>to regain 1 Power Point every 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Improved.Rapid.Recharge</p>
<p><b> Requirements:</b> Veteran, Rapid Recharge</p>
<p>The character regains 1 Power Point every </p>
<p>15 minutes.</p>
<p>Soul.Drain</p>
<p><b>Rank:</b>  Seasoned, Arcane  Background </p>
<p>(any  but  Weird  Science),  Knowledge </p>
<p>(Arcana) d10+</p>
<p>Spellcasters,  mentalists,  and  other  arcane </p>
<p>types in dire need of Power Points may use this </p>
<p>Edge to drain energy from their own souls. To use </p>
<p>this dangerous ability, the arcane character first </p>
<p>decides how many Power Points he wants to draw </p>
<p>from himself. Then he makes a Spirit roll minus </p>
<p>the number of points he’s trying to drain. (This is </p>
<p>a free action.) On a Spirit total of 1 or less, the </p>
<p>character suffers a wound and falls unconscious </p>
<p>for 1d6 hours. On a failure, the character suffers </p>
<p>a wound. On a success or better, the character </p>
<p>gets the points he needed and may attempt to </p>
<p>cast a spell with them immediately (they may not </p>
<p>be saved).</p>
<p>Professional.Edges</p>
<p>Professional Edges are very special abilities that </p>
<p>reflect many years of practicing a particular trade. </p>
<p>In some cases they may also represent special </p>
<p>blessings from higher powers as well.</p>
<p>These Edges help you create a character who </p>
<p>is  far  more  competent  in  his  chosen  field  than </p>
<p>most others. If you want to make a very effective </p>
<p>Mad Scientist, for example, you could combine </p>
<p>the Arcane Background (Weird Science) with the </p>
<p>Gadgeteer and Mr. Fix It Edges.</p>
<p>Professional  Edges  represent  many  years  of </p>
<p>training  so  their  Requirements  are  quite  high. </p>
<p>Players may purchase Professional Edges after </p>
<p>character creation, but should usually lead up </p>
<p>to  it  story-wise  by  practicing  the  affected </p>
<p>trade  during  down-time  or  in  between </p>
<p>adventures. The  time  spent  acquiring </p>
<p>one of these abilities is subjective and </p>
<p>up  to  the  Game  Master,  but  makes </p>
<p>the game much more believable if a </p>
<p>little narrative time is spent training.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Stacking:</b>  Bonuses  to  the </p>
<p>same  Trait  from  different </p>
<p>Professional  Edges  do  not </p>
<p>stack.  If  you  make  a  hero </p>
<p>with  both  the  Woodsman </p>
<p>and the Thief Edges, for </p>
<p>example, he gains +2 </p>
<p>to  his  Stealth  skill, </p>
<p>not +4.</p>
<p>Ace</p>
<p><b>R e q u i r e m e n t s : </b></p>
<p>Novice, Agility d8+</p>
<p>Aces  are  special  pilots  and </p>
<p>drivers who feel more comfortable </p>
<p>behind the wheel, throttle, or flight </p>
<p>stick than on their own two feet.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--42</p>
<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p>Aces add +2 to Boating, Driving, and Piloting </p>
<p>rolls. In addition, they may also spend Bennies </p>
<p>to make Soak rolls for any vehicle or vessel they </p>
<p>control. This is a Boating, Driving, or Piloting roll </p>
<p>at –2 (cancelling their usual +2). Each success </p>
<p>and raise negates a wound and any critical hit </p>
<p>that would have resulted from it.</p>
<p>Acrobat</p>
<p><b>Requirements: </b> Novice,  Agility  d8+, </p>
<p>Strength d6+</p>
<p>Those who have formal training in the acrobatic </p>
<p>arts  or  are  naturally  agile  may  take  this  Edge. </p>
<p>It  adds  +2  to  all Agility  rolls  made  to  perform </p>
<p>acrobatic maneuvers (including Trick maneuvers), </p>
<p>and also adds +1 to a character’s Parry as long </p>
<p>as he has no encumbrance penalty.</p>
<p>Adept</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b>  </p>
<p>Novice,  Arcane </p>
<p>Background (Miracles), Martial Artist, Faith </p>
<p>d8+, Fighting d8+</p>
<p>Adepts  are  holy  warriors  who  have  trained </p>
<p>themselves to be living weapons. Some do so to </p>
<p>be ultimate warriors; others do it in the service of </p>
<p>a cause or deity.</p>
<p>As a free action, an adept can spend 1 Power </p>
<p>Point to gain AP 2 with all of his unarmed attacks </p>
<p>until his next action.</p>
<p>In addition, upon taking this Edge and at each </p>
<p>new  Rank,  they  may  choose  to  change  the </p>
<p>trappings of one of the following powers to work </p>
<p>only  on  themselves  but  be  activated  as  a  free </p>
<p>action: <i>boost/lower trait, deflection, healing, smite, </i></p>
<p>or<i> speed</i>. The Adept must have the power to begin </p>
<p>with, and this does not allow him to activate more </p>
<p>than one power in a round.</p>
<p>Assassin</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b>  Novice,  Agility  d8+, </p>
<p>Climbing d6+, Fighting d6+, Stealth d8+</p>
<p>Assassins are trained killers who know how to </p>
<p>kill  with  deadly  precision — if  they  can  properly </p>
<p>approach  their  prey. Assassins  add  +2  to  any </p>
<p>damage  roll  where  they  strike  a  foe  unawares </p>
<p>(even with ranged attacks).</p>
<p>Champion</p>
<p><b>Requirements: </b></p>
<p>Novice,  Arcane </p>
<p>Background (Miracles), Spirit d8+, Strength </p>
<p>d6+, Vigor d8+, Faith d6+, Fighting d8+</p>
<p>Champions are holy (or unholy) men and women </p>
<p>chosen to fight for a particular deity or religion. </p>
<p>Most are pious souls ready and willing to lay down </p>
<p>their lives for a greater cause, but some may have </p>
<p>been born into the role and follow their path with </p>
<p>some reluctance.</p>
<p>Champions  fight  the  forces  of  darkness  (or </p>
<p>good).  They  add  +2  damage  when  attacking </p>
<p>supernaturally evil (or good) creatures, and have </p>
<p>+2  Toughness  when  suffering  damage  from </p>
<p>supernaturally evil (or good) sources, including </p>
<p>arcane powers and the weapons, claws, teeth, </p>
<p>etc., of such creatures.</p>
<p>Gadgeteer</p>
<p><b>Requirements: </b> Novice, Arcane  Back-</p>
<p>ground (Weird Science), Smarts d8+, Repair </p>
<p>d8+, Weird Science d8+, at least two other </p>
<p>scientific Knowledge skills at d6+</p>
<p>These  mechanical  gurus  are  so  technically </p>
<p>savvy they can quickly build a machine to handle </p>
<p>nearly any situation.</p>
<p>Once  per  game  session,  a  gadgeteer  can </p>
<p>create  a  “jury-rigged”  device  from  spare  parts. </p>
<p>The  device  functions  just  like  any  other  Weird </p>
<p>Science  device,  and  uses  any  power  available </p>
<p>to Weird Scientists in that setting (though this is </p>
<p>still subject to Rank restrictions). It has half the </p>
<p>inventor’s Power Points, and once these are used </p>
<p>up, the gadget burns out and does not recharge. </p>
<p>The inventor must have access to some parts and </p>
<p>a reasonable amount of time (GM’s call, but at </p>
<p>least 1d20 minutes) to create the gizmo.</p>
<p>Holy/Unholy.Warrior</p>
<p><b>Requirements: </b></p>
<p>Novice,  Arcane </p>
<p>Background (Miracles), Spirit d8+, Faith d6+</p>
<p>Acolytes,  clerics,  paladins,  holy  slayers,  and </p>
<p>other avatars of the gods are frequently tasked </p>
<p>with battling the forces of evil in the mortal world. </p>
<p>This Edge gives them a slight advantage against </p>
<p>such foes.</p>
<p>As an action, a priest or other holy person may </p>
<p>call upon his chosen deity to repulse supernaturally </p>
<p>evil creatures, such as the undead, demons, and </p>
<p>the like. It also works on evil characters with the </p>
<p>Arcane Background (Miracles) Edge.</p>
<p>Repulsing evil costs 1 Power Point and has a </p>
<p>range of the character’s Spirit. Targeted creatures </p>
<p>within that range must make a Spirit roll. Failure </p>
<p>means the creature is Shaken; a 1 means it is </p>
<p>destroyed. Wild Cards suffer an automatic Wound </p>
<p>instead.</p>
<p>A  character  may  also  be  an  Unholy  Warrior </p>
<p>working  for  the  forces  of  evil.  In  this  case, </p>
<p>he  repulses  good  creatures,  such  as  angels, </p>
<p>paladins,  or  good  characters  with  Arcane </p>
<p>Background (Miracles).</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>

<p>Character.Creation</p>
<p>Investigator</p>
<p><b>Requirements: </b> Novice,  Smarts  d8+, </p>
<p>Investigation d8+, Streetwise d8+</p>
<p>Investigators have spent a great deal of time </p>
<p>researching ancient legends, working the streets, </p>
<p>or  deducing  devilish  mysteries.  Some  of  these </p>
<p>heroes  are  actual  Private  Investigators  for  hire </p>
<p>while others may be sleuthing mages in a fantasy </p>
<p>world  or  perhaps  inquisitive  college  professors </p>
<p>stumbling upon Things Man Was Not Meant to </p>
<p>Know in the dark of night. Investigators add +2 </p>
<p>to Investigation and Streetwise rolls, as well as </p>
<p>Notice rolls made to search through evidence.</p>
<p>Jack-of-All-Trades</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Novice, Smarts d10+</p>
<p>Through  advanced  schooling,  book-learning, </p>
<p>computer-enhanced  skill  programs,  or  just </p>
<p>amazing  intuitive  perception,  your  hero  has  a </p>
<p>talent for picking up skills on the fly. There is little </p>
<p>he can’t figure out given a little time and a dash </p>
<p>of luck.</p>
<p>Any time he makes an unskilled roll for a Smarts-</p>
<p>based skill, he may do so at d4 instead of the </p>
<p>usual d4–2.</p>
<p>McGyver</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b>  Novice,  Smarts  d6+, </p>
<p>Repair d6+, Notice d8+</p>
<p>This character can improvise something when </p>
<p>the need for a tool arises. He suffers no negative </p>
<p>penalties on Trait rolls for lack of equipment in </p>
<p>most situations.</p>
<p>In  addition,  given  a  few  simple  tools,  props, </p>
<p>or devices, he can generally rig devices to help </p>
<p>escape from death-traps, weapons to match some </p>
<p>bizarre  need,  or  otherwise  create  something </p>
<p>that’s  needed  when  such  a  thing  isn’t  actually </p>
<p>present. The extent of this is completely up to the </p>
<p>Game Master, but creativity should be rewarded, </p>
<p>particularly  in  dire  situations  where  few  other </p>
<p>answers are possible.</p>
<p>Mentalist</p>
<p><b>Requirements: </b></p>
<p>Novice,  Arcane </p>
<p>Background  (Psionics),  Smarts  d8+, </p>
<p>Psionics d6+</p>
<p>Mentalists  are  masters  of  mind  control  and </p>
<p>psionics. Some are pulp heroes, others are trained </p>
<p>in  secret  government  academies  to  root  out </p>
<p>traitors. Their frequent toying with human minds </p>
<p>gives them a +2 on any opposed Psionics roll, </p>
<p>whether they are using their powers against a foe </p>
<p>or are trying to defend against a rival Mentalist.</p>
<p>Mr..Fix.It</p>
<p><b>Requirements: </b></p>
<p>Novice,  Arcane </p>
<p>Background (Weird Science), Smarts d10+, </p>
<p>Repair d8+, Weird Science d8+, at least two </p>
<p>other scientific Knowledge skills at d6+</p>
<p>The  inventor  adds  +2  to  Repair  rolls.  With  a </p>
<p>raise, he halves the time normally required to fix </p>
<p>something. This means that if a particular Repair </p>
<p>job already states that a raise repairs it in half the </p>
<p>time, a Mr. Fix It could finish the job in one-quarter </p>
<p>the time with a raise.</p>
<p>Scholar</p>
<p><b>Requirements: </b> Novice,  d8+  in  affected </p>
<p>skill</p>
<p>Learned  professors,  devoted  students,  and </p>
<p>amateur enthusiasts spend months of their lives </p>
<p>studying particular subjects. They become experts </p>
<p>in these fields, and rarely fail to answer questions </p>
<p>in their particular area of expertise.</p>
<p>Pick any two Knowledge skills the Scholar has </p>
<p>a d8 or better in. Add +2 to your total whenever </p>
<p>these skills are used. Those who study military </p>
<p>history have a natural edge when commanding </p>
<p>troops in Mass Battles (see page 106)—a +2 to </p>
<p>a Knowledge (Battle) roll can mean the difference </p>
<p>between a rousing victory and a crushing defeat.</p>

<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p>Thief</p>
<p><b>Requirements: </b> Novice,  Agility  d8+, </p>
<p>Climbing d6+, Lockpicking d6+, Stealth d8+</p>
<p>Thieves  specialize  in  deceit,  treachery,  and </p>
<p>acrobatics. They can be invaluable where traps </p>
<p>must  be  detected,  walls  must  be  climbed,  and </p>
<p>locks must be picked.</p>
<p>Thieves add +2 to Climbing, Lockpick, Stealth, </p>
<p>as well as Notice or Repair rolls that relate to traps </p>
<p>and similar devices. The bonus to Stealth does </p>
<p>not apply when the character is in a wilderness </p>
<p>environment—only in urban areas.</p>
<p>Wizard</p>
<p><b>Requirements: </b></p>
<p>Novice,  Arcane </p>
<p>Background  (Magic),  Smarts  d8+, </p>
<p>Knowledge (Arcana) d8+, Spellcasting d6+</p>
<p>Wizards  range  from  young  apprentices  to </p>
<p>frighteningly powerful supreme sorcerers. They </p>
<p>are  often  physically  weak,  however,  and  rarely </p>
<p>have  the  divine  powers  or  healing  abilities  of </p>
<p>priestly spellcasters. What they lack in spiritual </p>
<p>favor, however, they more than make up for in </p>
<p>utility and eldritch might.</p>
<p>Wizards tend to learn their craft in formalized </p>
<p>institutions or under the tutelage of experienced </p>
<p>masters.  Each  raise  a  Wizard  gets  on  his </p>
<p>Spellcasting roll reduces the cost of the spell by </p>
<p>1 Power Point. The Wizard must have the points </p>
<p>available to cast the spell in the first place before </p>
<p>rolling.</p>
<p>Woodsman</p>
<p><b>Requirements: </b> Novice,  Spirit  d6+, </p>
<p>Survival d8+, Tracking d8+</p>
<p>Woodsmen  are  rangers,  scouts,  and  hunters </p>
<p>who are more at home in the wilderness than in </p>
<p>urban areas. They are skilled trackers and scouts, </p>
<p>and know how to live off the land for months at </p>
<p>a time. Woodsmen gain +2 to Tracking, Survival, </p>
<p>and  Stealth  rolls  made  in  the  wilderness  (not </p>
<p>towns, ruins, or underground).</p>
<p>Social.Edges</p>
<p>Getting people to do what you want is a critical </p>
<p>skill in most any setting. These Edges help your </p>
<p>hero do just that.</p>
<p>Charismatic</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Novice, Spirit d8+</p>
<p>Your hero has learned how to work with others, </p>
<p>even those who might be somewhat opposed to </p>
<p>him or his efforts. This adds +2 to his Charisma.</p>
<p>Common.Bond</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b>  Wild  Card,  Novice,  Spirit </p>
<p>d8+</p>
<p>This Edge signifies a special link between close </p>
<p>companions—such as a typical party. It doesn’t </p>
<p>matter whether or not the characters get along </p>
<p>perfectly or not, they’ve just formed a close and </p>
<p>common bond during their epic adventures.</p>
<p>A  character  with  this  Edge  may  freely  give </p>
<p>his  Bennies  to  any  other  Wild  Card  he  can </p>
<p>communicate with. This represents the character </p>
<p>giving his verbal or spiritual support to the ally. </p>
<p>The  player  should  say  what  his  character  is </p>
<p>doing to give the support. The gesture could be </p>
<p>as complex as a rousing speech, or as simple as </p>
<p>a knowing nod.</p>
<p>Connections</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Novice</p>
<p>Whether  it’s  to  the  Feds,  the  cops,  the  Mob, </p>
<p>or  some  big  corporation,  your  heroine  knows </p>
<p>someone on the inside—someone who is willing </p>
<p>to lend her a hand on occasion (usually once per </p>
<p>game session).</p>
<p>This  Edge  may  be  taken  more  than  once, </p>
<p>but  each  time  must  be  applied  to  a  different </p>
<p>organization.  The  GM  should  also  ensure </p>
<p>the  organization  is  limited  to  a  single,  unique </p>
<p>organization. A  hero  may,  for  instance,  have </p>
<p>Connections (US Army), but he shouldn’t have a </p>
<p>blanket Connections (Military).</p>
<p>To use a character’s Connections requires that </p>
<p>she  first get  in  touch  with  one of  her  contacts. </p>
<p>This  requires  a  Streetwise  roll.  Failure  means </p>
<p>the particular contact wasn’t available, their cell </p>
<p>phone wasn’t on, or they were otherwise tied up.</p>
<p>Once  in  contact,  the  hero  must  make  a </p>
<p>Persuasion roll. The GM should feel free to modify </p>
<p>both the Persuasion roll and any results based on </p>
<p>the circumstances.</p>
<p>A  failure  indicates  the  heroine’s  contacts  just </p>
<p>couldn’t come through this time, or perhaps just </p>
<p>weren’t  persuaded  that  their  help  was  really </p>
<p>necessary. </p>
<p>On  a  success,  the  contact  might  share </p>
<p>information, but won’t do anything too risky to help. </p>
<p>On a raise, the contact is willing to leak sensitive </p>
<p>information, but stops short of outright betrayal.</p>
<p>Two  or  more  raises  means  the  heroine  has </p>
<p>pushed  the  right  buttons  and  can  count  on </p>
<p>serious  help. The  Connection  will  risk  serious </p>
<p>consequences for the heroine, and if she needs </p>
<p>financial assistance, may provide more than he’s </p>
<p>comfortable with. If the heroine asks for muscle, </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--45</p>
<p>Character.Creation</p>
<p>the  contact  delivers  either  one  expert  (a  safe-</p>
<p>cracker, wheel-man, security expert, etc.) or five </p>
<p>average fighter-types for the contact’s particular </p>
<p>organization (a mob boss sends five thugs, the </p>
<p>Army sends five infantrymen, etc.).</p>
<p>Strong.Willed</p>
<p><b>Requirements: </b>Novice, Intimidation d6+, </p>
<p>Taunt d6+</p>
<p>Characters  with  strong  willpower  use  their </p>
<p>voice,  steely  stares,  or  quick  wits  to  unnerve </p>
<p>their  opponents.  Strong  Willed  adds  +2  to  a </p>
<p>character’s Intimidation and Taunt rolls, as well </p>
<p>as his Spirit and Smarts rolls when resisting Test </p>
<p>of Wills attacks.</p>
<p>Weird.Edges</p>
<p>Weird Edges are slightly supernatural and only </p>
<p>appropriate in games with those elements. </p>
<p>Beast.Bond</p>
<p><b>Requirements: </b>Novice</p>
<p>Some individuals can exert incredible will over </p>
<p>their animal companions. These characters may </p>
<p>spend their own Bennies for any animals under </p>
<p>their control, including mounts, pet dogs, familiars, </p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>Beast.Master</p>
<p><b>Requirements: </b>Novice, Spirit d8+</p>
<p>Animals  like  your  hero,  and  won’t  attack  him </p>
<p>unless he attacks them first or they are enraged </p>
<p>for some reason. His “animal magnetism” is so </p>
<p>great he’s attracted a loyal animal of some sort </p>
<p>as  well. This  is  typically  a  dog,  wolf,  or  raptor, </p>
<p>though the GM may allow other companions if it </p>
<p>fits the setting. </p>
<p>The beast is an Extra (not a Wild Card). If it </p>
<p>should be killed, the hero finds a replacement in </p>
<p>2d6 days.</p>
<p>Danger.Sense</p>
<p><b>Requirements: </b>Novice</p>
<p>Your hero can sense when something bad is </p>
<p>about to happen. Anytime he’s about to be the </p>
<p>victim of a surprise attack, ambush, or other nasty </p>
<p>surprise, he gets a Notice roll at –2 just before the </p>
<p>attack or event occurs. If successful, the character </p>
<p>knows something is about to happen and may take </p>
<p>appropriate action against it. This means the hero </p>
<p>is on Hold for the first round of a combat. Should </p>
<p>the hero fail his roll, he still follows the normal </p>
<p>Surprise rules, if applicable (see page 73).</p>
<p>Healer</p>
<p><b>Requirements: </b>Novice, Spirit d8+</p>
<p>A hero with this Edge adds +2 to all Healing </p>
<p>rolls (including natural healing rolls for his own </p>
<p>wounds), whether natural or magical in nature. </p>
<p>Up to five companions traveling with a Healer add </p>
<p>the bonus to their natural healing rolls as well.</p>
<p>Liquid.Courage</p>
<p><b>Requirements: </b>Novice, Vigor d8+</p>
<p>Your hero processes alcohol far differently than </p>
<p>most. The  round  after  consuming  a  stiff  drink </p>
<p>(at least 8 ounces of hard liquor or equivalent), </p>
<p>the character’s Vigor increases by one die type </p>
<p>(increasing Toughness as well). The hard drinker </p>
<p>can  also  ignore  one  level  of  wound  modifiers </p>
<p>(which  stacks  with  other  abilities  that  do  the </p>
<p>same).</p>
<p>The effect lasts for one hour after it begins. If the </p>
<p>drunkard seeks inebriation he suffers –2 to Smarts </p>
<p>and Agility-based rolls for as long as he continues </p>
<p>to drink and the next 1d6 hours thereafter.</p>
<p>Scavenger</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Novice, Luck</p>
<p>Once  per  session  the  hero  may  “suddenly </p>
<p>remember”  that  he  has  a  much-needed  piece </p>
<p>of equipment on his person. The item must be </p>
<p>capable of being stored in the hero’s pocket or bag </p>
<p>(assuming he has one), and the Game Master has </p>
<p>the final word on what can be found.</p>
<p>Wild.Card.Edges</p>
<p>The  following  Edges  work  only  when  the </p>
<p>character  is  dealt  a  Joker  during  combat. The </p>
<p>Edge’s effects are in addition to the usual effects </p>
<p>of being dealt a Joker.</p>
<p>Dead.Shot</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b>  Wild  Card,  Seasoned, </p>
<p>Shooting/Throwing d10+</p>
<p>The character doubles his total damage when </p>
<p>making a successful Shooting or Throwing attack </p>
<p>this round.</p>
<p>Mighty.Blow</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b>  Wild  Card,  Seasoned, </p>
<p>Fighting d10+</p>
<p>The character doubles his total damage when </p>
<p>making a successful Fighting attack this round.</p>
<p>Power.Surge</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b>  Wild  Card,  Seasoned, </p>
<p>arcane skill d10+</p>
<p>This Edge is for those characters with Arcane </p>
<p>Backgrounds. When dealt a Joker, the character </p>
<p>recovers 2d6 Power Points. He may not exceed </p>
<p>his usual limit.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--46</p>
<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p>Legendary.Edges</p>
<p>Most Legendary Edges are very specific to their </p>
<p>campaign world—such as gaining a stronghold </p>
<p>or divine favor—but a few fit most anywhere, as </p>
<p>shown below.</p>
<p>Followers</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Wild Card, Legendary</p>
<p>Heroes  often  acquire  dedicated  warbands, </p>
<p>“merry men,” or others who voluntarily follow the </p>
<p>hero on his adventures.</p>
<p>Each time this Edge is chosen, five followers join </p>
<p>the hero’s band. Casualties are not automatically </p>
<p>replaced, so a hero may need to choose this Edge </p>
<p>again on occasion to replenish his losses. The </p>
<p>followers must have some way to eat and earn </p>
<p>income, and generally want a piece of whatever </p>
<p>loot, treasure, or other rewards the hero acquires. </p>
<p>Otherwise, they are completely dedicated to their </p>
<p>idol and risk their lives for him under any normal </p>
<p>conditions. They won’t knowingly throw their lives </p>
<p>away except under very special circumstances.</p>
<p>The GM determines the followers’ statistics, but </p>
<p>in general, use the Soldier statistics presented on </p>
<p>page 93. Followers generally come with only basic </p>
<p>equipment depending on their particular setting </p>
<p>(warriors  in  fantasy  come  with  at  least  leather </p>
<p>armor and short swords, for example). The hero </p>
<p>must purchase any additional equipment for his </p>
<p>Followers himself.</p>
<p>Martial.Arts.Master</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b>  Legendary,  Improved </p>
<p>Martial Arts, Fighting d12+</p>
<p>The warrior is deadly with his hands. He adds +2 </p>
<p>to his bare-handed damage every time he takes </p>
<p>this Edge, up to a maximum of five times for a </p>
<p>total damage bonus of +10.</p>
<p>Professional</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Legendary, d12 in affected </p>
<p>Trait</p>
<p>The character is an expert at a particular skill or </p>
<p>attribute (his choice). That Trait becomes d12+1. </p>
<p>This  Edge  may  be  selected  more  than  once, </p>
<p>but it may never be applied to the same skill or </p>
<p>attribute twice.</p>
<p>Expert</p>
<p><b>Requirements: </b>Legendary, Professional </p>
<p>in affected Trait</p>
<p>As above, but the Trait increases to d12+2.</p>
<p>Master</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b>  Wild  Card,  Legendary, </p>
<p>Expert in affected Trait</p>
<p>The character’s Wild Die increases to a </p>
<p>d10  when  rolling  a  particular Trait  of  his </p>
<p>choice. This Edge may be chosen multiple </p>
<p>times,  though  it  only  affects  a  particular </p>
<p>Trait once.</p>
<p>Sidekick</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Wild Card, Legendary</p>
<p>A  character  who  triumphs  over  evil  time  and </p>
<p>time  again  becomes  an  inspiration  to  others. </p>
<p>Eventually,  one  of  these  young  crusaders  may </p>
<p>attempt to join the hero in his epic quests.</p>
<p>The hero gains a  Novice Rank sidekick. The </p>
<p>sidekick  is  a  Wild  Card,  gains  experience  as </p>
<p>usual, and has abilities that complement or mimic </p>
<p>his hero’s.</p>
<p>The player character should control his sidekick </p>
<p>just like any other ally. Of course, the sidekick may </p>
<p>occasionally cause trouble (by getting captured, </p>
<p>running into danger when he’s not supposed to, </p>
<p>etc.). The player should be prepared for his “Edge” </p>
<p>to occasionally become a “Hindrance.”</p>
<p>If the sidekick dies, he isn’t replaced unless the </p>
<p>hero chooses this Edge again.</p>
<p>Tough.as.Nails</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Legendary</p>
<p>Your  hero  is  a  grizzled  veteran.  Increase  his </p>
<p>Toughness by +1.</p>
<p>Improved.Tough.as.Nails</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Legendary, Tough as Nails</p>
<p>Increase  your  hero’s  Toughness  by </p>
<p>another +1.</p>
<p>Weapon.Master</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> Legendary, Fighting d12</p>
<p>Increase your hero’s Parry by +1.</p>
<p>Master.of.Arms</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b>  Legendary,  Weapon </p>
<p>Master</p>
<p>Increase your hero’s Parry by another +1.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>

<p>Character.Creation</p>
<p>Advancement</p>
<p>At  the  end  of  each  game  session  (usually </p>
<p>4-6  hours  of  gaming),  the  GM  awards  1  to  3 </p>
<p>Experience Points to everyone in the group, based </p>
<p>on these guidelines.</p>
<p>Experience.Awards</p>
<p><b>  Award </b></p>
<p><b>Situation</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>1 </p>
<p>The group accomplished little or had </p>
<p>a very short session.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2 </p>
<p>The group had more successes than </p>
<p>failures.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3 </p>
<p>The group succeeded greatly, and their </p>
<p>adventure had a significant impact on </p>
<p>the overall story.</p>
<p>Ranks</p>
<p>As a character gains more Experience Points, </p>
<p>he goes up in “Rank.” This is a rough measure of </p>
<p>how powerful the hero is. As characters progress </p>
<p>in experience, new Ranks allow access to more </p>
<p>powerful Edges.</p>
<p>Rank.Table</p>
<p><b> </b></p>

<p> </p>
<p>60-79 </p>
<p>Heroic</p>
<p> </p>
<p>80+ </p>
<p>Legendary</p>
<p>Every 5 points accumulated grants a hero an </p>
<p>Advance. An Advance lets a character do one of </p>
<p>the following:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Gain a new Edge.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Increase a skill that is equal to or greater than </p>
<p>its linked attribute by one die type.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Increase two skills that are lower than their </p>
<p>linked attributes by one die type each.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Buy a new skill at d4.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Increase one attribute by a die type.*</p>
<p><i>*You  may  only  choose  this  option  once </i></p>
<p><i>per Rank. No Trait may be raised above a </i></p>
<p><i>d12  (but  see  the  Professional  and  Expert </i></p>
<p><i>Legendary  Edges).  Legendary  characters </i></p>
<p><i>may raise an attribute every other Advance.</i></p>
<p>Starting.With.Experienced.Characters</p>
<p>If the GM lets you make a character who has </p>
<p>already earned some experience, simply make a </p>
<p>character as usual and then grant her that many </p>
<p>Advances. A  Veteran  character,  for  example, </p>
<p>has 40 Experience Points, so you would make a </p>
<p>normal character and grant her eight Advances.</p>
<p>Additional  goods,  equipment,  or  other  assets </p>
<p>must  be  determined  by  the  Game  Master  and </p>
<p>the particular setting. As a quick rule of thumb, a </p>
<p>character’s starting funds double with each Rank </p>
<p>after Novice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Replacement Characters:</b> When a character </p>
<p>dies,  his  new  hero  begins  play  with  one  less </p>
<p>Advance than his last.</p>
<p>Legendary.Characters</p>
<p>Legendary  characters  are  major  forces  in </p>
<p>their worlds, and often have political power and </p>
<p>influence  as  well  as a  host of  Edges  to defeat </p>
<p>those who oppose them.</p>
<p>Once  a  hero  reaches  Legendary  status,  the </p>
<p>rules for Advances change a bit. The character </p>
<p>now Advances  every  time  he  accumulates  10 </p>
<p>Experience  Points  instead  of  5,  but  a  world  of </p>
<p>new Edges opens up to him as well. “Legendary </p>
<p>Edges”  allow  heroes  to  accumulate  followers, </p>
<p>build  castles,  start  massive  corporations,  and </p>
<p>otherwise become major players in their campaign </p>
<p>world.</p>
<p>Legendary  characters  may  also  choose  to </p>
<p>improve  an  attribute  every  other Advance. A </p>
<p>few Legendary Edges are included in this book. </p>
<p>Many more are quite specific to their particular </p>
<p>campaign  worlds,  and  so  are  covered  in  other </p>
<p>Savage Settings.</p>

<p>• Choose any race available in your setting.</p>
<p>2).Traits</p>
<p>• Your hero starts with a d4 in each attribute, and </p>
<p>has 5 points with which to raise them. Raising an </p>
<p>attribute a die type costs 1 point.</p>
<p>• You have 15 points for skills. Each die type in a </p>
<p>skill costs 1 point up to the linked attribute. Going </p>
<p>over the linked attribute costs 2 points per level.</p>
<p>•  Charisma  is  equal  to  the  total  bonuses  or </p>
<p>penalties given by Edges and Hindrances.</p>
<p>• Pace is 6”.</p>
<p>• Parry is equal to 2 plus half Fighting.</p>
<p>• Toughness is equal to 2 plus half Vigor. Go </p>
<p>ahead and add the bonus granted by the armor </p>

<p>Chapter.Two:.</p>
<p>Gear</p>
<p>In the following section is a sampling of gear </p>
<p>from  the  ancient  era  to  the  near  future.  Below </p>
<p>are  some  notes  you’ll  need  to  understand  the </p>
<p>equipment lists.</p>
<p><b>3RB: </b> The  weapon  has  a  three-round  burst </p>
<p>selector (see page 81).</p>
<p><b>AP  (Armor  Piercing): </b> The  weapon  or  round </p>
<p>ignores this many points of Armor. A weapon with </p>
<p>an AP value of 4, for instance, ignores 4 points of </p>
<p>Armor. Excess AP is simply lost.</p>
<p><b>Auto:</b>  This  full-auto  weapon  may  fire  in </p>
<p>automatic (single shot) mode.</p>
<p><b>Armor:</b> This is the amount of Armor provided </p>
<p>by the equipment, which is added to the wearer’s </p>
<p>Toughness  when  the  covered  location  is  hit  in </p>
<p>combat. A character who wears multiple layers </p>
<p>of armor only gains the highest bonus—they do </p>
<p>not  stack.  Note  that  unless  an  attacker  states </p>
<p>otherwise, hits are always directed at the victim’s </p>
<p>torso.</p>
<p><b>Caliber:</b> The number listed in parentheses after </p>
<p>firearms is the caliber of bullet it fires. Use this </p>
<p>when figuring ammunition costs or trying to figure </p>
<p>out if the ammo from one weapon fits in another.</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b>  Equipment  prices  are  relative  both  to </p>
<p>the starting funds of $500 <i>and</i> to their tech level, </p>
<p>so a Springfield musket doesn’t really cost $250 </p>
<p>in  1862. That’s  just  the  “worth”  of  the  weapon </p>
<p>relative to the tech level and the typical setting </p>
<p>it’s intended for. Remember that when comparing </p>
<p>the $150 musket to the $150 AK47—the weapons </p>
<p>are both “standard” for the typical environment </p>
<p>they’re  found  in,  even  though  the AK  is  vastly </p>
<p>superior  to  the  musket.  Characters  in  military </p>
<p>campaigns  shouldn’t  buy  equipment  at  all—</p>
<p>they’re simply assigned their gear. Some items </p>
<p>simply list “Military” as their cost, meaning they </p>
<p>are typically bought by large national militaries and </p>
<p>then supplied to the troops under their command. </p>
<p>Such weapons are not normally available on the </p>
<p>open market.</p>
<p>Economies  are  critical  to  balancing  game </p>
<p>worlds,  so  the  Game  Master  is  encouraged  to </p>
<p>re-price goods for his particular campaign.</p>
<p><b>Damage: </b> Damage  is  listed  in  terms  of  dice. </p>
<p>Projectile weapons have fixed damage (such as </p>
<p>2d6). Melee weapons have damage based on the </p>
<p>wielder’s Strength die plus another die, as listed </p>
<p>under  individual  weapon  entries. A  dagger,  for </p>
<p>instance, inflicts Str+1d4 damage.</p>
<p><b>Double Tap:</b> The weapon can rapidly fire two </p>
<p>rounds. Rather than rolling twice, add +1 to the </p>
<p>Shooting and damage rolls.</p>
<p><b>HW (Heavy Weapon):</b> The weapon can affect </p>
<p>vehicles or other devices with Heavy Armor.</p>
<p><b>HE (High Explosive):</b> High explosive rounds </p>
<p>use a burst template, the size of which is noted </p>
<p>in  the  weapon  or  ammunition’s  notes.  See  the </p>
<p>rules for Area of Effect attacks in Chapter Three.</p>
<p><b>Minimum  Strength: </b> A  character  whose </p>
<p>Strength is lower than the weapon die can use the </p>
<p>weapon, but there are penalties. First, the weapon </p>
<p>die can’t be higher than his Strength die. So if a </p>
<p>scrawny kid (d4 Str) picks up a long sword (d8), </p>
<p>he rolls 2d4 damage, not d4+d8. A brawny hero </p>
<p>with Str d10 rolls d10+d8 when using the same </p>
<p>long sword. </p>
<p>Second, if the Strength die isn’t at least equal </p>
<p>to the weapon die, the attacker doesn’t get any of </p>
<p>the weapon’s inherent bonuses, such as +1 Parry </p>
<p>or Reach. He still retains any penalties, however </p>
<p>(like –1 Parry).</p>
<p>If a weapon has a damage listed as Str+d8+2, </p>
<p>for  instance,  then  the  minimum  Strength  the </p>
<p>wielder must have is a d8.</p>
<p>Some ranged weapons list a minimum Strength </p>
<p>to use as well. A character with a lower Strength </p>
<p>can use the weapon, but suffers a –1 penalty to his </p>
<p>attack roll for every step of difference between his </p>
<p>Strength and the minimum Strength required. The </p>
<p>penalty is ignored if the weapon can be braced on </p>
<p>a bipod or other support. </p>
<p><b>Parry +X:</b> The weapon adds the bonus to the </p>
<p>character’s Parry score when used.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--55</p>
<p>Gear</p>
<p><b>Range:</b> This lists the weapon’s Short, Medium, </p>
<p>and Long range. Ranges are listed in inches so </p>
<p>that  you  can  use  a  ruler  to  move,  shoot,  and </p>
<p>fight on the table-top with miniatures. Each inch </p>
<p>is equal to 2 yards in the real world, so that 5” is </p>
<p>really 10 yards, or 30 feet.</p>
<p>Weapon ranges are “effective” ranges for the </p>
<p>table-top. If you need to know the real world range </p>
<p>of a weapon (for battles that don’t take place on </p>
<p>the table-top, for instance), multiply each range </p>
<p>bracket by 2.5. A tank round with a Long range of </p>
<p>300, for example, has a “real world” Long range </p>
<p>of 750”, or 1500 yards.</p>
<p><b>Rate of Fire:</b> This is the maximum number of </p>
<p>shots that may be taken by this weapon per action. </p>
<p>Unless a weapon says otherwise, the user can fire </p>
<p>up to the weapon’s Rate of Fire (rather than its </p>
<p>full Rate of Fire). If a single shot is taken, it uses </p>
<p>a single round of ammunition and does not incur </p>
<p>any recoil penalties. Two or more shots with such </p>
<p>weapons always incurs the –2 autofire penalty.</p>
<p><b>Reach:</b> Weapons with “reach” allow their user to </p>
<p>make Fighting attacks at the listed range. A reach </p>
<p>of 1”, for example, allows a character to strike a </p>
<p>target 1” distant. Weapons without a reach value </p>
<p>can only strike targets at arm’s length (adjacent).</p>
<p>Reach  can  be  very  important  when  fighting </p>
<p>from horseback and <i>against</i> mounted foes (see </p>
<p>page 83). </p>
<p><b>Reloading:</b> Antique weapons, such as muskets </p>
<p>and  crossbows,  are  very  slow  to  reload.  Each </p>
<p>weapon tells you how many actions it requires </p>
<p>to reload, such as 1/3, which means the weapon </p>
<p>can fire every third round if the firer does nothing </p>
<p>but load every action. Characters can load and </p>
<p>walk at no penalty. If the character tries to run and </p>
<p>load, he must make an Agility roll (at the usual </p>
<p>–2 penalty for running). Failure simply means no </p>
<p>progress toward reloading was made that action.</p>
<p><b>Semi-Auto: </b> The  weapon  fires  on  semi-auto </p>
<p>and can take advantage of the double-tap rules </p>
<p>(page 81).</p>
<p><b>Snapfire Penalty:</b> Certain weapons, such as </p>
<p>sniper rifles, are very inaccurate if fired “from the </p>
<p>hip”  rather  than  using  their  excellent  sights  or </p>
<p>scopes. If the character moves in the action he </p>
<p>fires, he suffers a –2 penalty.</p>
<p><b>Three Round Burst:</b> The  weapon can fire 3 </p>
<p>rounds with one pull of the trigger. This adds +2 </p>
<p>to the Shooting and damage rolls at the cost of </p>
<p>the extra ammunition.</p>
<p>Encumbrance</p>
<p>In  general,  you  shouldn’t  worry  about </p>
<p>Encumbrance.  Characters  will  usually  carry  no </p>
<p>more  than  their  characters  think  they  actually </p>
<p>need. But occasionally it may become dramatically </p>
<p>important—such  as  during  a  chase  or  when </p>
<p>attempting  to  lug  a  heavy  treasure  away  from </p>
<p>a  roaring  dragon!  When  that  occurs,  use  the </p>
<p>guidelines below.</p>
<p>A character can carry five times his Strength die </p>
<p>type in pounds without incurring any penalties. </p>
<p>This is called his “Load Limit.” A character with </p>
<p>a Strength of d8, for example, can comfortably </p>
<p>carry  40  pounds.  (Ignore  normal  clothes  when </p>
<p>figuring weight.)</p>
<p>Carrying too much weight inflicts a –1 penalty for </p>
<p>every additional multiple of your Load Limit. The </p>
<p>penalty applies to all Agility and Strength totals, as </p>
<p>well as skills linked to either of those two attributes.</p>
<p>A  hero  with  a  d8  Strength,  for  example,  has </p>
<p>a Load Limit of 40 pounds. He can carry 41-80 </p>
<p>pounds  at a –1  penalty  to  his  Strength, Agility, </p>
<p>and related skill rolls. He could also carry 81-120 </p>
<p>pounds at –2, or 121-160 pounds at –3.</p>
<p>Characters cannot regularly carry weight that </p>
<p>inflicts a penalty of more than –3. They may be </p>
<p>able to lift greater weights (up to a –4 penalty) </p>
<p>for a few short steps at the discretion of the GM, </p>
<p>however.</p>

<p>Selected.Gear.Notes</p>
<p>Below  are  notes  for  some  of  the  weapons, </p>
<p>armor,  and  other  devices  you’ll  find  on  the </p>
<p>Equipment Lists.</p>
<p>Armor</p>
<p>Note that the weights listed for most large suits </p>
<p>of  armor  such  as  hauberks,  plate,  and  power </p>
<p>armor, are figured for their “distributed” weight. </p>
<p>This assumes the armor is properly fitted, which </p>
<p>takes  a  Knowledge  (Armorsmithing)  roll,  some </p>
<p>basic tools, and 1d6 hours. If armor is not properly </p>
<p>fitted (such as when wearing armor taken from a </p>
<p>foe), the weight is typically doubled.</p>
<p>Kevlar</p>
<p>Kevlar offers 2 points of protection against most </p>
<p>attacks. Kevlar weave “binds” spinning bullets and </p>
<p>so negates up to 4 points of AP from bullets, and </p>
<p>provides +4 protection from them as well.</p>
<p>Power.Armor</p>
<p>Power armor suits carry much of their own mass, </p>
<p>hence the low weight values. Scout suits weigh </p>
<p>100  pounds  when  powered  down,  Battle  suits </p>
<p>weigh 150, and Heavy Suits weigh 220 pounds. </p>
<p>All power armor contains comm-units with a 5-mile </p>
<p>range. Powered armor typically lasts for one week </p>
<p>without recharge. It requires a special recharging </p>
<p>facility and 10 hours to return to full power. The </p>
<p>GM  may  decide  suits  lose  power  faster  under </p>
<p>excessive use.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Scout Suit: </b>These suits are made for </p>
<p>reconnaissance.  In  addition  to  the </p>
<p>standard comm-unit, they are coated </p>
<p>in stealth paint that adds +4 to Stealth </p>
<p>rolls  vs.  radar  and  other  automated </p>
<p>detection systems (but not people).</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Battle Suit: </b>This is the standard power </p>
<p>armor worn by most heavy troopers in </p>
<p>futuristic settings. It increases Strength </p>
<p>by one die type, adds +2 to Pace, </p>
<p>and  allows  users  to  jump  2d6” </p>
<p>horizontally  or  1d6”  vertically. </p>
<p>A Heads Up Display provides </p>
<p>targeting information for linked </p>
<p>weapons,  adding  +1  to  the </p>
<p>wearer’s Shooting rolls.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Heavy  Suit: </b> Heavy  suits  (or </p>
<p>assault suits) are designed for </p>
<p>hard fighting under the most </p>
<p>intense  combat  conditions. </p>
<p>They  subtract  2  from  Pace </p>
<p>and  boost  Strength  by  two </p>
<p>die  types. They  mount  at  least  one  heavy </p>
<p>weapon of some sort such as a flamethrower </p>
<p>or a minigun, and feature enhanced targeting </p>
<p>computers  that  add  +2  to  the  character’s </p>
<p>Shooting rolls.</p>
<p>Shields</p>
<p>If a character with a shield is hit by a ranged </p>
<p>attack  from  the  protected  side,  roll  damage </p>
<p>normally, but add the Armor bonus of the shield to </p>
<p>the character’s Toughness (it acts as an obstacle).</p>
<p>Ranged.Weapons.&amp;.Accessories</p>
<p>Bipods</p>
<p>Most full machine guns are also equipped with </p>
<p>either  an  integral  or  detachable  bipod.  Once </p>
<p>deployed, these provide a more stable shooting </p>
<p>position and help control recoil. It takes one action </p>
<p>to deploy a bipod and set the weapon up. Once </p>
<p>in position the autofire penalty is reduced to –1. </p>
<p>If the hero moves, this benefit is negated and he </p>
<p>will have to spend another action to redeploy the </p>
<p>bipod.</p>
<p>Scopes</p>
<p>Optical scopes can be attached to all manner </p>
<p>of firearms from rifles to hand guns, and magnify </p>
<p>targets to make distance shooting easier. A scope </p>
<p>provides a +2 Shooting bonus to shots at Medium </p>
<p>Range  or  higher  as  long  as  the  firer  does  not </p>
<p>move this round.</p>
<p>Shotguns</p>
<p>Shotguns  fire  a  spread  of  metal </p>
<p>balls (also called “shot”), and so do </p>
<p>more damage at close range where </p>
<p>the spread is less and more of the </p>
<p>shot  hits  the  target.  Farther  away, </p>
<p>the  shot  spreads  more  and  causes </p>
<p>less damage. Because of the increased </p>
<p>chance  of  hitting  someone  due  to </p>
<p>the  spread,  shotguns  add  +2  to  their </p>
<p>user’s  Shooting  rolls. They  cause </p>
<p>1d6 damage at Long range, 2d6 </p>
<p>at  Medium,  and  3d6  at  Short </p>
<p>range.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Double  Barrels:</b> </p>
<p>Shotguns  with  two  attached </p>
<p>barrels  are  called  “double </p>
<p>barrels.” If the attacker wants </p>
<p>to fire both barrels at once, he </p>
<p>rolls  an  additional  Shooting </p>
<p>die  just  like  when  firing  Full </p>
<p>Auto (plus Wild Die), including </p>
<p>recoil (which cancels out the </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--57</p>
<p>Gear</p>
<p>usual  +2  for  shotguns).  Roll  damage  for  each </p>
<p>successful shot separately.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Slugs:</b>  Shotguns  can  also  fire  slugs.  The </p>
<p>attacker doesn’t get the +2 shotgun bonus to his </p>
<p>Shooting roll, but the damage is 2d10 regardless </p>
<p>of the range increment.</p>
<p>Special.Weapons</p>
<p>Bouncing.Betties</p>
<p>These deadly mines are designed to pop up into </p>
<p>the air and rain shrapnel down from about head-</p>
<p>height. Only full overhead cover offers an Armor </p>
<p>bonus against such devices. Simply being prone </p>
<p>offers no protection from these deadly explosives.</p>
<p>Cannons</p>
<p>Cannons can fire three different types of shells: </p>
<p>solid shot, shrapnel, and canister. The crew can </p>
<p>pick the type of ammunition to be loaded each </p>
<p>time it reloads.</p>
<p>Solid Shot is just that—big round balls made </p>
<p>to batter walls or plow through packed ranks of </p>
<p>troops. To fire, the leader of the crew makes a </p>
<p>Shooting roll as usual. A target directly behind and </p>
<p>adjacent to the first is also hit on a d6 roll of 1-3, </p>
<p>and takes full damage. This continues until there </p>
<p>are no more adjacent foes.</p>
<p>Shrapnel is an explosive shell filled with metal </p>
<p>balls, nails, and other scraps. The debris is hurled </p>
<p>outward when the shell explodes, shredding lightly </p>
<p>armored targets in a shower of steel. Shrapnel is </p>
<p>an area effect attack, and uses the Medium Burst </p>
<p>Template.</p>
<p>Canister is a shell made to detonate inside the </p>
<p>barrel  of  the  cannon. The  jagged  metal  inside </p>
<p>the “canister” then sprays out of the cannon to </p>
<p>shred anything within its deadly cone like a giant </p>
<p>shotgun. To  determine  the  effects  of  canister, </p>
<p>place a ruler in front of the cannon in the direction </p>
<p>you want it to fire and make a Shooting roll with no </p>
<p>range modifiers. If the shot is missed, move the </p>
<p>far end of the ruler 1” left or right (roll randomly).</p>
<p>Now place a Medium Burst Template at the near </p>
<p>end of the ruler and move it directly forward along </p>
<p>that path for 24”. Every target under the template </p>
<p>is hit for 2d6 damage. Cover acts as Armor just </p>
<p>as with any area effect weapon, meaning prone </p>
<p>characters add +2 to their Toughness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Reloading: </b> Cannons  require  one  action  to </p>
<p>reload  with  a  crew  of  four,  or  two  actions  with </p>
<p>less crewmen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Line of Sight:</b> Cannon crews must be able to </p>
<p>see their targets to hit them. Howitzers, mortars, </p>
<p>and  bombards  may  fire  at  targets  they  cannot </p>
<p>see  (assuming  they  know  roughly  where  the </p>
<p>target is) at a –4 penalty, and double deviation </p>
<p>(see <b>Combat</b>).</p>
<p>Flamethrowers</p>
<p>Flamethrowers include any device that squirts </p>
<p>an incendiary liquid or even pure flame. To use </p>
<p>it, the attacker places the small end of the Cone </p>
<p>Template at the tip of his character’s weapon, and </p>
<p>the large end on as many targets as he’s able. </p>
<p>The attacker then makes a Shooting roll at +2. </p>
<p>Defenders who make an Agility roll equal to or </p>
<p>greater than the attacker’s Shooting total move </p>
<p>out of the way and are unaffected. The rest suffer </p>
<p>the weapon’s damage (typically 2d10) and roll to </p>
<p>see if they catch fire (see <b>Fire</b>).</p>
<p>Like other area effect weapons, flamethrowers </p>
<p>typically  bypass  most  body  armor  (see<b> Area </b></p>
<p><b>Effect Attacks</b>).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Vehicular  Flamethrowers: </b> Military </p>
<p>organizations  often  have  flamethrowers  with </p>
<p>much longer ranges. The flame fired from a British </p>
<p>Crocodile, for example, has a range of about 70 </p>
<p>yards (35”). The flame must be arced to reach </p>
<p>these  distances  however,  so  a  character  may </p>
<p>choose to use a Medium Burst Template instead </p>
<p>of the Cone Template when using such weapons. </p>
<p>The center of the template may be placed up to the </p>
<p>maximum range of the particular flamethrower, as </p>
<p>listed in its notes. This is treated just like any other </p>
<p>area effect attack, though targets still get a chance </p>
<p>to dodge out of the cone as detailed above.</p>
<p>Grenades</p>
<p>A  character  within  the  burst  radius  has  two </p>
<p>additional  options.  To  pick  up  and  throw  the </p>
<p>grenade before it goes off, he must make an Agility </p>
<p>roll at –4 (or –2 if he was on Hold). Failure means it </p>
<p>goes off and he takes an additional die of damage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Covering  Grenades:</b> A character  may also </p>
<p>throw  himself  on  a  grenade.  He  takes  double </p>
<p>the  normal  dice  of  damage  for  his </p>
<p>heroic act, but his total Toughness </p>
<p>is  subtracted  from  the  damage </p>
<p>inflicted  on  other  characters </p>
<p>in  the  blast  radius. </p>
<p>Allies won’t normally </p>
<p>perform </p>
<p>such </p>
<p>a </p>
<p>suicidal act, though </p>
<p>t h e  </p>
<p>G M  </p>
<p>m i g h t </p>
<p>rule  otherwise  in </p>
<p>specific  situations, </p>
<p>such  as  when  an </p>
<p>ally  has  a  “loyal” </p>
<p>personality.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--58</p>
<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p>Missiles</p>
<p>Air-to-air  (or  space-to-space)  weapons  are </p>
<p>designed  to  destroy  enemy  fighters  and  other </p>
<p>small targets with a focused warhead. To activate, </p>
<p>the pilot must first “capture” the target’s signature </p>
<p>on his own control panel. This is accomplished by </p>
<p>various  means  including  heat-signature,  radar, </p>
<p>emissions,  or  even  profile,  depending  on  tech </p>
<p>level.</p>
<p>To get a lock, the pilot picks his target and must </p>
<p>then  succeed  at  an  opposed  Piloting  roll. The </p>
<p>attacker must subtract range modifiers from the </p>
<p>Piloting roll just as if he were Shooting.</p>
<p>Once  locked,  the  pilot  decides  how  many </p>
<p>missiles to release (usually up to his full payload </p>
<p>depending on his craft). At Short Range, the target </p>
<p>has one round to evade. He has two rounds (and </p>
<p>chances) at Medium Range, and three at Long </p>
<p>Range.</p>
<p>Evading a missile requires a Piloting roll at –4. </p>
<p>Note that many craft contain additional evasion </p>
<p>systems,  such  as  chafe  or  flares,  that  add  +4 </p>
<p>to this roll if they’re of the right type (flares for </p>
<p>heat-seeking missiles and chafe for radar-guided </p>
<p>missiles).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Air  to  Ground  Targets:</b>  Use  the  same </p>
<p>procedure as above but the target makes a Driving </p>
<p>or Boating roll against the attacker’s Piloting skill.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Surface to Air Missiles:</b> As above, but the </p>
<p>attacker makes a Shooting roll and the defender </p>
<p>makes a Piloting roll.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Anti-Missile  Systems:</b>  Larger  ships  often </p>
<p>have anti-missile systems designed to shoot down </p>
<p>missiles with targeted lasers, walls of matter, or </p>
<p>hails of lead. All systems require a modicum of skill </p>
<p>and a lot of luck. First the crewman in charge of </p>
<p>the particular AMS battery makes a Shooting roll </p>
<p>minus the range. (Don’t subtract for the size or </p>
<p>speed of the missile—the AMS already accounts </p>
<p>for that.) Each successful hit has a 1 in 6 chance </p>
<p>of shooting down the torpedo. A Phalanx system </p>
<p>with a RoF of 5, for example, rolls 5 dice, and each </p>
<p>die that comes up a “1” shoots a missile down. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Obstacles:</b> Evading prey can add +2 to the </p>
<p>Piloting  roll  with  substantial  cover—such  as </p>
<p>asteroids, canyon walls, or the hull of a capital </p>
<p>ship.</p>

<p>Vehicles</p>
<p>On the following pages are a number of sample </p>
<p>vehicles for land, air, and water, including some </p>
<p>military  vehicles  such  as  tanks  and  armored </p>
<p>personnel carriers.</p>
<p><b>Acc/Top  Speed </b> is  the  vehicle’s Acceleration </p>
<p>and Top  Speed  in  inches  per  round. The Top </p>
<p>Speed of vehicles is set for battlefields (not the </p>
<p>open highway, where they can usually double their </p>
<p>speed). They’re adapted to work on the table-top, </p>
<p>which means they’re not entirely realistic but work </p>
<p>well for the game. Top Speed is typically half the </p>
<p>vehicle’s operational speed for military vehicles, </p>
<p>or one-quarter speed for civilian cars. Acceleration </p>
<p>varies far more widely—use the examples from </p>
<p>the Vehicle Table as a guide.</p>
<p><b>Climb </b>is a relative value used to determine if </p>
<p>an aircraft has a better ability to gain altitude than </p>
<p>another, as you’ll see in the Chase Rules on page </p>
<p>82. If converting vehicles of your own, use the </p>
<p>following guidelines:</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>Climb </b></p>
<p><b>Example Aircraft</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>–2 </p>
<p>Balloons, steampunk helicopters</p>
<p> </p>
<p>–1 </p>
<p>Craft which ascend relatively slowly, </p>
<p>such as civilian helicopters</p>
<p> </p>
<p>0 </p>
<p>WWII  bombers,  “heavy”  aircraft, </p>
<p>modern helicopters</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1 </p>
<p>Light civilian aircraft, medium fighters</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2 </p>
<p>Early light fighters</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3 </p>
<p>Jets, very agile fighters, aircraft which </p>
<p>ascend very quickly</p>
<p>Previous editions of <i>Savage Worlds</i> used Climb </p>
<p>as an actual measurement of inches an aircraft </p>
<p>could ascend in a round. In setting books where </p>
<p>Climb  uses  the  previous  Climb  values,  simply </p>
<p>estimate based on the table above.</p>
<p><b>Toughness</b>  is  the  vehicle’s  base  durability </p>
<p>including Armor (in parentheses); vehicles  with </p>
<p>three  numbers  listed  have  different  values  for </p>
<p>Front/Sides/Rear. Figuring Toughness for vehicles </p>
<p>is very difficult due to different types of materials </p>
<p>or armor, weak points vs. strong points, and so </p>
<p>on, but in general you can use this chart to set </p>
<p>the base Toughness:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Weight in Tons </b></p>
<p><b>Base Toughness</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>&lt;1 </p>
<p>6–8</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2–4 </p>
<p>9–11</p>
<p> </p>
<p>5–25 </p>
<p>11–12</p>
<p> </p>
<p>26–60 </p>
<p>13–14</p>
<p> </p>
<p>61–100 </p>
<p>15–18</p>
<p> </p>
<p>100–200 </p>
<p>19–22</p>
<p> Every 100 tons thereafter </p>
<p>+3–5 Toughness</p>
<p>For Armor,  figure  the  average  thickness  in </p>
<p>inches of any metal on the vehicle and multiply </p>
<p>by 2.5. This is a good baseline and will need more </p>
<p>tinkering if it’s really important based on the type </p>
<p>of metal, how much of the vehicle it covers, and </p>
<p>so on.</p>
<p><b>Passengers </b>lists the number of crew plus any </p>
<p>additional passengers it can transport. A notation </p>
<p>of “2+8,” for example, means it has a crew of 2 </p>
<p>and can carry 8 additional passengers.</p>
<p><b>Cost</b> is the average price of the vehicle. If the </p>
<p>cost is “Military,” the cost is beyond the means of </p>
<p>most characters and is typically purchased only </p>
<p>by state militaries.</p>
<p>Special.Notes</p>
<p><b>Air Bags:</b> Passengers with air bags roll half the </p>
<p>normal damage dice in a collision (round down), </p>
<p>minus one.</p>
<p><b>Amphibious:</b>  The  vehicle  can  enter  water </p>
<p>without flooding or capsizing. See the individual </p>
<p>descriptions  for  their  movement  rates  while  in </p>
<p>water.</p>
<p><b>AMCM (Anti-Missile Counter Measures):</b> Some </p>
<p>jets or spacecraft are equipped with anti-missile </p>
<p>counter measures, such as chaff, flares, or decoy </p>
<p>pods. The  number  of AMCM  is  a  reflection  of </p>
<p>“bursts,” not actual flares or decoys. When used, </p>
<p>an AMCM adds +2 to the user’s Piloting roll <i>that </i></p>
<p><i>round only</i> for purposes of evading missiles.</p>
<p><b>Fixed Gun:</b> The vehicle’s weapon cannot rotate.</p>
<p><b>Four Wheel Drive (4WD):</b> These vehicles treat </p>
<p>each inch of difficult terrain as 1.5 (instead of 2).</p>
<p><b>Heavy Armor:</b> Only weapons marked as Heavy </p>
<p>Weapons can hurt this vehicle, regardless of the </p>
<p>damage roll. This keeps a really lucky pistol shot </p>
<p>from destroying a tank. Vehicles with Heavy Armor </p>
<p>halve damage they take from colliding with other </p>
<p>obstacles  (including  vehicles)  that  don’t  have </p>
<p>Heavy Armor.</p>
<p><b>Heavy Weapon:</b> This weapon can harm vehicles </p>
<p>equipped with Heavy Armor.</p>
<p><b>Hover:</b> The vehicle is a hovercraft and can ignore </p>
<p>most low terrain obstacles and water.</p>
<p><b>Infrared Night Vision:</b> Thermal imaging devices </p>
<p>halve darkness penalties (round down) for heat-</p>
<p>producing targets.</p>
<p><b>Night Vision:</b> “Starlight” and other night vision </p>
<p>equipment  eliminate  Dim  and  Dark  lighting </p>
<p>penalties.</p>

<p>  <b>Weapons:</b> DT 7.62 turret</p>
<p><b>Sloped Armor:</b>  In  the  best  armored  vehicles, </p>
<p>armor is sloped so as to increase the chance that </p>
<p>a hit will be deflected off the tank’s armor. Ballistic </p>
<p>attacks against this target suffer a –2 penalty.</p>
<p><b>Spacecraft:</b> The vehicle is designed for use in </p>
<p>outer space. Those followed with /Atmospheric </p>
<p>can enter and exit planetary orbits as well.</p>
<p><b>Stabilizer:</b> A  stabilizer  reduces  the  Unstable </p>
<p>Platform penalty for whatever weapon it’s attached </p>
<p>to (usually its main gun unless stated otherwise) </p>
<p>to  –1  (rather  than  the  usual  –2). An  Improved </p>
<p>Stabilizer negates the penalty entirely.</p>
<p><b>Stealth Paint: </b>This is black paint that imposes a </p>
<p>–4 to rolls made to spot the vehicle with sensors.</p>
<p><b>Tracked:</b> Unless otherwise noted, the vehicle is </p>
<p>assumed to have wheels. Tracked vehicles can </p>
<p>climb over most low obstacles such as logs, and </p>
<p>treat each inch of difficult terrain as 1.5 (instead </p>
<p>of 2).</p>
<p><b>Weapons:</b> Weapons are statted in the vehicle’s </p>
<p>text. Note that the Rate of Fire for missiles and </p>
<p>rockets indicates how many may be fired in one </p>
<p>action.</p>

<p>Chapter.Three:.</p>
<p>Game.Rules</p>
<p>The <i> Savage  Worlds </i> rules  provide  a  simple </p>
<p>framework for your tales of adventure and glory. </p>
<p>In this chapter we’ll show you how to make basic </p>
<p>skill and attribute checks and make your combats </p>
<p>Fast, Furious, and Fun!</p>
<p>Wild.Cards.&amp;.Extras</p>
<p>Your hero (a player character), and unique allies, </p>
<p>villains, and monsters are collectively called “Wild </p>
<p>Cards.” These beings have a little better chance at </p>
<p>doing things, are a little tougher to put down, and </p>
<p>are generally more detailed than common guards, </p>
<p>minions, or lackeys—collectively called “Extras.”</p>
<p>Wild Cards are noted with a design of some sort </p>
<p>before their name, like this:</p>
<p>X</p>
<p>.Serious.Chapel</p>
<p>The  actual  Wild  Card  symbol  varies  and  is </p>
<p>usually  themed  for  the  particular  setting,  such </p>
<p>as a skull-and-crossbones for a pirate game like </p>
<p><i>50 Fathoms,</i> or the visage of the puritan himself </p>
<p>in <i>Solomon Kane®,</i> but a symbol in front of the </p>
<p>name always means the character is a Wild Card<i>.</i></p>
<p>Besides  your  own  characters,  it’s  up  to  the </p>
<p>Game Master to decide which characters are Wild </p>
<p>Cards. The sergeant of the City Watch probably </p>
<p>isn’t a Wild Card, but Sergeant Grimlock of the City </p>
<p>Watch, a veteran of many wars and an important </p>
<p>character in your campaign, certainly is. Skytch </p>
<p>the Dragon is also a Wild Card, though his three </p>
<p>young  wyrms  aren’t. You’ll  see  the  difference </p>
<p>between Wild Cards and Extras as you continue </p>
<p>to read, but for later reference, the differences are:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Wild Cards can suffer multiple wounds.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Wild Cards always roll a Wild Die along with </p>
<p>their Trait die when making tests and take the </p>
<p>better of the two.</p>
<p>Trait.Tests</p>
<p>To use an attribute or skill, simply roll the die </p>
<p>assigned to it. If the result is a 4 or better (the </p>
<p>“Target Number” or TN), the action is successful. </p>
<p>For example, if a  character’s Strength is a  d6, </p>
<p>he  rolls  a  six-sided  die.  On  a  4  or  better,  he’s </p>
<p>successful.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Modifiers: </b>Circumstances modify the die roll, </p>
<p>such as shooting at something at long range or </p>
<p>finding a well-hidden clue. Some things, such as </p>
<p>ranged attacks, have standard modifiers. It’s up </p>
<p>to the GM to determine any modifiers for more </p>
<p>subjective tasks, such as spotting an ambush or </p>
<p>eavesdropping on a conversation through a door.</p>
<p>In general, an easy task, such as finding tracks </p>
<p>in the mud, is made at +2. A difficult task, such as </p>
<p>finding tracks by torchlight, is made at –2. A very </p>
<p>difficult task, such as finding tracks in a rainstorm, </p>
<p>is made at –4.</p>
<p>Aces</p>
<p>All  Trait  tests  and  damage  rolls  in <i> Savage </i></p>
<p><i>Worlds</i> are open-ended. That means that when </p>
<p>you roll the highest number possible on a die (a 6 </p>
<p>on a d6, an 8 on a d8, and so on), you get to roll </p>
<p>that die again and add it to the total. This is called </p>
<p>an “Ace.” Any modifiers to the die roll should be </p>
<p>tacked on after adding up an Aced roll.</p>
<p>Raises</p>
<p>Sometimes  it’s  important  to  know  just  how </p>
<p>successful a Trait test was. Every 4 points over </p>
<p>what you need for success is called a “raise.” If </p>
<p>your hero needs a 4 to Shoot an opponent and </p>
<p>rolls an 11, he hits with one raise (and would have </p>
<p>two raises with a roll of 12). Figure raises after </p>
<p>adjusting for any modifiers.</p>
<p>Unskilled.Attempts</p>
<p>If a character doesn’t have a skill for an action </p>
<p>he’s attempting, he rolls a d4 and subtracts 2 from </p>
<p>the total. Wild Card characters still get their Wild </p>
<p>Die for these rolls (which are also subject to the –2 </p>
<p>penalty). The GM may decide that a character has </p>
<p>no chance at a particular skill if he has no training </p>
<p>in it—such as performing surgery or flying a plane.</p>
<p>Opposed.Rolls</p>
<p>Sometimes rolls are “opposed” by an opponent. </p>
<p>If two characters are wrestling for control of an </p>
<p>ancient  artifact,  for  example,  they  both  make </p>
<p>Strength rolls and compare results.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--71</p>
<p>Game.Rules</p>
<p>When this happens, the acting character gets </p>
<p>his Trait total first. If he wants to spend Bennies </p>
<p>(see the next section), he does so now. When </p>
<p>he’s satisfied with his total, his opponent gets to </p>
<p>roll. The highest total wins. In a tie, the two foes </p>
<p>continue to struggle with no clear victor.</p>
<p>The  winner  of  an  opposed  roll  considers </p>
<p>his  opponent’s  total  as  his TN  for  purposes  of </p>
<p>determining any raises.</p>
<p>Cooperative.Rolls</p>
<p>Sometimes characters may want to cooperate </p>
<p>and help a friend complete some kind of urgent </p>
<p>task. If two or more characters want to perform a </p>
<p>task together (and the GM decides it’s possible </p>
<p>for them to do so), the lead character makes his </p>
<p>roll and adds +1 for every success and raise his </p>
<p>companions achieved on their own rolls. This has </p>
<p>a normal maximum of +4 for all tasks except those </p>
<p>of Strength, which have no maximum.</p>
<p>Characters may <i>not </i>make cooperative rolls if </p>
<p>they don’t actually have the skill in question. (You </p>
<p>can’t make default rolls to aid with Boating, for </p>
<p>example, if your character doesn’t actually have </p>
<p>the Boating skill.)</p>
<p>Group.Rolls</p>
<p>When you want to make a noncombat Trait roll </p>
<p>for a group of Extras, roll one Trait die as usual </p>
<p>along with a Wild Die. Take the better of the two </p>
<p>as always and treat this as the group’s total. This </p>
<p>way  you  get  a  nice  average  without  having  to </p>
<p>make  individual  Fear  rolls  for  every  Extra  who </p>
<p>sees a dragon, or watch one clumsy soldier ruin </p>
<p>a stealthy approach for his 49 companions.</p>
<p>The.Wild.Die</p>
<p>Extras roll a single die as described above. But </p>
<p>Wild Cards roll an extra d6 and take the highest </p>
<p>of their normal die or the “Wild Die” when making </p>
<p>skill or attribute rolls. Wild Dice are rolled just like </p>
<p>the Trait die, and can Ace as well (see above).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Critical Failure: </b>The downside is that snake-</p>
<p>eyes (double 1s) on one of these rolls is a critical </p>
<p>failure. The GM gets to make up something rotten </p>
<p>to happen to your character. That’s the price Fate </p>
<p>charges for making someone a hero.</p>
<p><i><b>Example: </b> Buck  Savage,  international </i></p>
<p><i>adventurer, faces wild-eyed cultists. He has </i></p>
<p><i>a d10 Shooting and rolls his d6 Wild Die. The </i></p>
<p><i>Wild Die comes up 4, but he Aces (a 10) on </i></p>
<p><i>the d10. He sets the Wild Die aside and rolls </i></p>
<p><i>the d10 again. He gets another 10, then rolls </i></p>
<p><i>again and gets a 3. His total is (10+10+3=) 23!</i></p>
<p>Bennies</p>
<p>Every now and then the dice may not work for </p>
<p>you. That’s why <i>Savage Worlds</i> gives you, the </p>
<p>player, a little control over your hero’s fate.</p>
<p>Every  player  starts  each  game  session  with </p>
<p>three “Bennies” (American slang for “benefits”), </p>
<p>represented by gaming stones or other tokens that </p>
<p>signify a little bit of good luck or fate. The Game </p>
<p>Master may also give you more Bennies for great </p>
<p>roleplaying, overcoming major obstacles, or even </p>
<p>entertaining everyone with an outlandish action, </p>
<p>side-splitting comment, or other memorable act. </p>
<p>(Tips for awarding Bennies can be found in the </p>
<p>Game Master’s section on page 145.)</p>
<p>You  can  use  Bennies  to  reroll  any Trait  test. </p>
<p>Make the entire roll from scratch. If you’re firing </p>
<p>three shots on full-auto and don’t like the results, </p>
<p>pick up all three dice and your Wild Die and roll </p>
<p>again.  You  can  keep  spending  Bennies  and </p>
<p>rerolling as long as you like, and take the best of </p>
<p>your attempts. If you roll a 5, for example, and a </p>
<p>Benny gets you a 4, keep the original 5 instead.</p>
<p>Bennies cannot be spent on tables, damage rolls </p>
<p>(unless a character has the No Mercy Edge), or </p>
<p>any other roll that isn’t a Trait roll.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Soak Rolls:</b> Bennies can also be used to save </p>
<p>your bacon from deadly attacks. Choose carefully </p>
<p>where you spend them! See <b>Damage</b> for complete </p>
<p>information on how to make Soak rolls.</p>
<p>Game.Master.Bennies</p>
<p>Game Masters get Bennies too. At the start of </p>
<p>each session, the GM gets one Benny for each </p>
<p>player character. He may use these for any of his </p>
<p>villains throughout the course of the game.</p>
<p>Each  of  the  GM’s  Wild  Cards  also  gets  two </p>
<p>Bennies per game session. They can use these </p>
<p>or any of the Bennies in the common pool to save </p>
<p>their  evil  skins,  but  they  can’t  share  their  own </p>
<p>Bennies with other nonplayer characters. </p>
<p>As with heroes, Bennies are not saved between </p>
<p>sessions.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--72</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Whether  they  are  the  blood-soaked  plains  of </p>
<p>Mars or the corpse-strewn battlefields of the far </p>
<p>future—these are <i>Savage Worlds </i>and there will </p>
<p>be violence. We recommend using miniatures or </p>
<p>markers of some sort so that players understand </p>
<p>their surroundings and can use the terrain to their </p>
<p>advantage. If miniatures aren’t your thing, see the </p>
<p>sidebar on page 73.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Distance:</b> Because the game assumes you </p>
<p>are  using  terrain  or  a  battle-mat  and  standard </p>
<p>28mm miniatures, movement and weapon ranges </p>
<p>are listed in inches. If you need to translate that </p>
<p>to regular distance, each inch is equal to 2 yards.</p>
<p>If the GM needs a different scale to accommodate </p>
<p>a  larger  battle,  such  as  a  long-range  firefight </p>
<p>between tank platoons, simply divide weapon and </p>
<p>movement ranges as needed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Time:</b>  When  a  fight  breaks  out,  game  time </p>
<p>breaks down into rounds of six seconds each. Ten </p>
<p>rounds, then, is one minute.</p>
<p>Using.Allies</p>
<p>Allied Extras are divided up among all the players </p>
<p>to control. This is a very important part of <i>Savage </i></p>
<p><i>Worlds<b></i> </b>because our settings often feature allied </p>
<p>bands of skilled hirelings, fellow grunts, or loyal </p>
<p>retainers, and the game is designed to handle them </p>
<p>quickly and easily. It’s also designed for the <i>players</i> </p>
<p>to control them—not the Game Master.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter whether or not the <i>characters </i></p>
<p>control the allies, only that the <i>players</i> do. This </p>
<p>keeps everyone involved in the action even if his </p>
<p>hero is out of the fight, and makes running large </p>
<p>combats much easier and fun for everyone. Of </p>
<p>course the GM can always take charge of Extras </p>
<p>when the need arises, but with good roleplayers, </p>
<p>this  should  rarely  be  necessary.  Some  tips  for </p>
<p>the Game Master on using Allies can be found </p>
<p>on page 146.</p>
<p>Initiative</p>
<p>The action in <i>Savage Worlds </i>is fast and furious. </p>
<p>To help the Game Master keep track of who goes </p>
<p>in what order and add a little randomness to the </p>
<p>game,  we  use  a  single  deck  of  playing  cards </p>
<p>with both Jokers left in to determine everyone’s </p>
<p>initiative.</p>
<p>Deal in characters as follows:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Every Wild Card is dealt a single card. Any </p>
<p>allies under that player’s control act on his </p>
<p>initiative card as well.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Each  group  of  Game  Master  characters, </p>
<p>such as all zombies, all wolves, and so on, </p>
<p>share a card.</p>
<p>Exactly which nonplayer character groups get </p>
<p>their own cards is up to the GM. If he wants to </p>
<p>break his 30 zombies into 5 groups of 6, that’s fine. </p>
<p>Your goal is to do whatever makes running the </p>
<p>battle as quick and easy as possible. Generally, </p>
<p>Wild Cards and other unique characters get their </p>
<p>own card.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Shuffle:</b> Shuffle the deck after any round in </p>
<p>which a Joker was dealt.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Large Groups:</b> In very large groups, or time-</p>
<p>sensitive games, the Game Master might want </p>
<p>to try dealing a single card per side (heroes and </p>
<p>villains). On the heroes’ turn, simply start at one </p>
<p>end of the group and work quickly around. This </p>
<p>will speed  things up  dramatically if that’s more </p>
<p>important than varying initiative order. If one or </p>
<p>more characters have Level Headed or Quick, let </p>
<p>that apply to the draw (but only once).</p>
<p>The.Countdown</p>
<p>Once  the  cards  are  dealt,  the  Game  Master </p>
<p>starts the round by counting down from the Ace to </p>
<p>the Deuce, with each group resolving its actions </p>
<p>when its card comes up. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Ties: </b>Ties are resolved by suit order: Spades </p>
<p>are  first,  then  Hearts,  Diamonds,  and  Clubs </p>
<p>(reverse alphabetical order).</p>
<p>Jokers</p>
<p>When  a  player  draws  a  Joker,  his  character </p>
<p>can  go  whenever  he  wants  in  the  round,  even </p>
<p>interrupting another character’s action if he wants. </p>
<p>In addition, add +2 to all Trait tests this round, and </p>
<p>+2 to damage totals as well!</p>
<p>Hold</p>
<p>A  hero  may  choose  to  wait  and  see  what </p>
<p>happens by taking a Hold action. He may then </p>
<p>go later in the round if he chooses. A Held action </p>
<p>lasts until it’s used. If a character has a Held card </p>
<p>when a new round starts, he’s not dealt in.</p>
<p>If  a  character  is  Shaken  while  on  Hold,  he </p>
<p>immediately  loses  his  “Hold”  status  and  any </p>
<p>remaining  actions  for  the  round.  If  the  victim </p>
<p>soaks the attack and avoids the Shaken result, </p>
<p>he remains on Hold.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Interrupting Actions: </b>If a character on Hold </p>
<p>wants to interrupt an action (including a rival who </p>
<p>was also on Hold), he and the opponent make </p>
<p>opposed Agility rolls. Whoever rolls highest goes </p>
<p>first.  In  the  rare  case  of  a  tie,  the  actions  are </p>
<p>simultaneous.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--73</p>
<p>Game.Rules</p>
<p>Surprise</p>
<p>Combat often starts before everyone involved </p>
<p>is prepared. An ambush, a sudden double-cross, </p>
<p>or a trap might all give one side in a fight an edge </p>
<p>over the other.</p>
<p>When this happens, the side that started the </p>
<p>fight  is  not  dealt  cards  but  begins  the  fight  on </p>
<p>Hold. Victims of the surprise attack must make </p>
<p>Notice rolls. Those who make it are dealt in as </p>
<p>usual. Those who fail get no card in the first round </p>
<p>of combat.</p>
<p>Design.Note.-.Action.Cards</p>
<p><i>Some  new  players  have  been  hesitant </i></p>
<p><i>to use cards for initiative. We’ve presented </i></p>
<p><i>optional  die-rolling  systems  in  previous </i></p>
<p><i>editions,  but  the  truth  is,  the  card-based </i></p>
<p><i>initiative system works and is a lot of fun. If </i></p>
<p><i>you’re new to it, try it. </i></p>
<p><i>We’ve found the excitement of drawing a </i></p>
<p><i>Joker—or getting a Queen when the monster </i></p>
<p><i>that’s about to kill your hero is on a Jack—is </i></p>
<p><i>a major part of the game and those who give </i></p>
<p><i>it a chance quickly realize how well it works </i></p>
<p><i>for  Savage  Worlds—particularly  when  it </i></p>
<p><i>comes to keeping track of large groups of </i></p>
<p><i>heroes and villains.</i></p>
<p>Games.Without.Miniatures</p>
<p>Weapon  ranges,  character  and  vehicle </p>
<p>movement rates, and even the templates are all </p>
<p>based on using figures on a table-top. That’s why </p>
<p>they’re  measured  in  inches  rather  than  yards, </p>
<p>miles-per-hour, and so on.</p>
<p>But many times you won’t want to use miniatures. </p>
<p>Here are some quick and dirty ways to handle </p>
<p>those  situations  that  are  usually  dependent  on </p>
<p>table-top measurements.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Range:</b> The  GM  should  simply  decide  how </p>
<p>far away targets are. Mentally, it’s much easier </p>
<p>for most people to think in yards. Remember that </p>
<p>every two yards is one inch on the table-top, so </p>
<p>if a target is about 20 yards away, it’s 10” away.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Templates:</b>  Without  exact  placement  of </p>
<p>miniatures  it’s  tricky  to  know  how  many  foes </p>
<p>might be caught by an area-effect attack (like a </p>
<p>grenade).  For  these  occasions,  figure  a  Small </p>
<p>Burst Template affects 1d3 foes, a Medium Burst  </p>
<p>or Cone Template affects 2d4 foes, and a Large </p>
<p>Burst Template catches 2d6 opponents.</p>
<p>Allies  adjacent  or  in  combat  with  these  foes </p>
<p>suffer damage as well unless the attack hits with </p>
<p>a raise.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--74</p>
<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p>Movement</p>
<p>Characters may move their full Pace (usually 6” </p>
<p>for humans) in a round. This is considered a free </p>
<p>action and doesn’t inflict a penalty to any other </p>
<p>actions, such as firing a weapon or taunting a foe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Crawling:</b> A character may crawl 2” per turn. </p>
<p>This counts as being prone when being fired upon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Crouching:</b> A  character  may  move  while </p>
<p>crouching  at  half  Pace.  He  may  run  while </p>
<p>crouched  (halve  his  total  Pace  after  rolling  for </p>
<p>running).  Ranged  attacks  against  him  suffer  a </p>
<p>–1 penalty.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Going Prone: </b>A character may fall prone at </p>
<p>any time during his action. Getting up costs 2” of </p>
<p>movement. See Prone on page 85 for the benefits </p>
<p>of being prone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Difficult  Ground:</b>  Difficult  ground  such  as </p>
<p>mud, steep hills, or snow, slows characters down. </p>
<p>Count each inch of difficult ground as two inches </p>
<p>for purposes of movement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Jumping:</b> A character can jump 1” horizontally </p>
<p>from a dead stop, or up to 2” with a “run and go.” </p>
<p>A successful Strength roll grants one extra inch </p>
<p>of distance.</p>
<p>Running</p>
<p>A  character  may  run  an </p>
<p>a d d i t i o n a l </p>
<p>1d6”  during  his  turn  if  he </p>
<p>wishes. Characters suffer a –2 </p>
<p>penalty (the standard multi-</p>
<p>action  penalty)  to  all </p>
<p>other actions made </p>
<p>while running.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Group  Running  Rolls: </b> When  rolling  for </p>
<p>a  group  of  nonplayer  characters,  villains,  or </p>
<p>monsters,  the  GM  or  controlling  player  makes </p>
<p>a  single  running  roll. The  whole  group  doesn’t </p>
<p>actually <i>have to </i>run—it’s just a convenient way </p>
<p>to save a little time in the heat of battle.</p>
<p>Actions</p>
<p>Characters  perform “actions” when their  card </p>
<p>comes  up  each  round. A  character  can  move </p>
<p>(see  Movement)  and  perform  one  regular </p>
<p>action—attacking, running, casting a spell, and </p>
<p>so on—without penalty.</p>
<p>Characters can perform a multitude of actions </p>
<p>when their card comes up in combat. The most </p>
<p>common actions are making Tests of Will, using a </p>
<p>power, or attacking with the Fighting or Shooting </p>
<p>skill. These are all covered on the following pages.</p>
<p>Simpler  actions  such  as  readying  an  item, </p>
<p>drawing a sword, or other quick tasks usually take </p>
<p>one action. More complex actions, such as lighting </p>
<p>a torch, digging through a backpack to find a small </p>
<p>item, and so on, might require a random amount </p>
<p>of time (such as 1d6 rounds). The Game Master </p>
<p>has the final say.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Readying  Weapons:</b>  Drawing  a  weapon </p>
<p>usually takes an entire round, but a character can </p>
<p>do it faster if she wants. This is an action, however, </p>
<p>and so inflicts the standard multi-action penalty of </p>
<p>–2 to the character’s attack roll.</p>
<p>Drawing  two  weapons  at  once,  drawing  a </p>
<p>weapon from a difficult location (such as an ankle </p>
<p>holster or inside a coat), or drawing a large or </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--75</p>
<p>Game.Rules</p>
<p>unwieldy  weapon  (a  rifle,  a  shotgun,  etc.),  still </p>
<p>inflicts a single –2 penalty, but requires an Agility </p>
<p>roll. If the roll is failed, the weapons are drawn but </p>
<p>the character may not attack that round.</p>
<p>Multiple.Actions</p>
<p>Characters may perform multiple actions such </p>
<p>as Intimidating someone while blasting away with </p>
<p>a shotgun, running and Fighting, attacking with a </p>
<p>weapon in each hand, and so on. Two important </p>
<p>rules apply:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A character can’t fire more than his weapon’s </p>
<p>Rate of Fire in one round</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A character may not make more than one </p>
<p>Fighting  attack  with  the  same  weapon  in </p>
<p>one round</p>
<p>In essence, a hero may not perform the same </p>
<p>action  twice  in  a  round—he  can’t  make  two </p>
<p>simultaneous Intimidation rolls or cast two different </p>
<p>spells. He could make a Fighting and a Shooting </p>
<p>attack if he had a gun in one hand and a knife in </p>
<p>the other, however, and could even issue a Taunt </p>
<p>at the same time. He could only make two Fighting </p>
<p>attacks if he had a knife in each hand, however </p>
<p>(or had the Frenzy Edge).</p>
<p>Each  additional  action  attempted  in  a  round </p>
<p>subtracts  2  from  all  the  hero’s  rolls.  If  an </p>
<p>adventurer  wants  to  fire  a  gun  with  one  hand </p>
<p>and slice at an adjacent foe with a sword in the </p>
<p>other, for instance, he subtracts 2 from both rolls. </p>
<p>If he also wanted to make a Test of Wills against </p>
<p>someone at the same time, he subtracts 4 from </p>
<p>all his rolls.</p>
<p>Wild Cards get their Wild Die on each action </p>
<p>as usual.</p>
<p>A moving character may perform these actions </p>
<p>at different points in his movement, but still suffers </p>
<p>the multi-action penalty. This might seem a little </p>
<p>odd in practice—a character might shoot a pistol, </p>
<p>move a few inches, then issue a Taunt—suffering </p>
<p>a –2 penalty to both even though the Taunt roll </p>
<p>has yet to be resolved—so make sure the player is </p>
<p>committed to both actions before resolving either.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Free Actions:</b> Some minor actions are “free” </p>
<p>and don’t inflict multi-action penalties. Speaking </p>
<p>a  short  sentence  or  two,  moving  up  to  the </p>
<p>character’s Pace, falling prone, resisting opposed </p>
<p>rolls, or dropping an item are all examples of free </p>
<p>actions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>One Wild Die Per Action:</b> When Wild Cards </p>
<p>roll multiple dice for a single action, such as when </p>
<p>firing a machine gun, they roll only one Wild Die. </p>
<p>A warrior with the Frenzy Edge, for example, rolls </p>
<p>two Fighting dice and one Wild Die. He can use </p>
<p>the Wild Die’s total to replace either of his Fighting </p>
<p>dice  if  he  chooses. The  Wild  Die  must  either </p>
<p>replace one of the regular dice or be ignored—it </p>
<p>never adds another action or attack to the roll.</p>
<p>Attacks</p>
<p>The heart of <i>Savage Worlds</i> is its fast, furious </p>
<p>combat. Here’s everything you need to know to </p>
<p>decimate your foes and keep your hero alive.</p>
<p>Melee.Attacks</p>
<p>The Target Number to hit an opponent is equal to </p>
<p>the opponent’s Parry score (2 plus half his Fighting </p>
<p>ability; that’s a 2 if he has no Fighting skill).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Bonus  Damage: </b> If  your  attack  hits  with  a </p>
<p>raise,  add  +1d6  to  your  damage  total  as  well! </p>
<p>The d6 may Ace just like any other damage roll.</p>
<p>Ranged.Attacks</p>
<p>The Shooting skill covers everything from pistols </p>
<p>to rocket launchers. The base TN to hit something </p>
<p>at Short range is 4 as usual. Shots at Medium </p>
<p>range subtract 2 from the Shooting roll, and shots </p>
<p>at Long range subtract 4 from the roll.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Bonus Damage: </b>If you hit your target with a </p>
<p>raise, add +1d6 to the damage total. This roll may </p>
<p>Ace just like any other damage roll.</p>
<p>Range.Modifiers</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>Range </b></p>
<p><b>Modifier</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Short </p>
<p>—</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Medium </p>
<p>–2</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Long </p>
<p>–4</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Rate of Fire:</b> The Rate of Fire is how many </p>
<p>Shooting dice the character rolls when firing the </p>
<p>weapon. These additional shots must be taken at </p>
<p>the same time, and each point of RoF grants the </p>
<p>hero another Shooting die. A pistol with a RoF of </p>
<p>2, for example, gives a character two Shooting </p>
<p>dice, which may be aimed at two different targets.</p>
<p>A submachine gun with a RoF of 3, for example, </p>
<p>allows the player to roll up to three Shooting dice </p>
<p>at  once  at  up  to  three  different  targets. These </p>
<p>shots can be split among all possible targets as </p>
<p>the player desires, but must all be taken at the </p>
<p>same time. A shooter with an Uzi can’t fire one </p>
<p>shot, then move and fire two more, for instance.</p>
<p>Wild Cards roll one Wild Die with the Shooting </p>
<p>roll, and can use it in place of one of the Shooting </p>
<p>dice if they choose.</p>
<p><i><b>Example: </b> A  special  agent  fires  a </i></p>
<p><i>submachine  gun  (RoF  3)  at  two  terrorists. </i></p>
<p><i>The  agent  is  a  Wild  Card  with  a  Shooting </i></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--76</p>
<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p><i>of d8, so he rolls 3d8 plus a Wild Die (d6). </i></p>
<p><i>The player decides to put two shots into the </i></p>
<p><i>closest terrorist and one at the further target. </i></p>
<p><i>He rolls the two at the closest terrorist first, </i></p>
<p><i>then rolls a third d8 for the second. He also </i></p>
<p><i>rolls his Wild Die.</i></p>
<p><i>He scores a hit on each with his Shooting </i></p>
<p><i>dice and misses with the third, but his Wild </i></p>
<p><i>Die  hit  so  he  replaces  one  of  the  failed </i></p>
<p><i>Shooting dice with it and gets his maximum </i></p>
<p><i>three hits (since that was his RoF).</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Firing  Blind:</b>  Sometimes  a  character  may </p>
<p>want  to  fire  at  targets  they  have  no  fix  on </p>
<p>whatsoever.  In  these  cases,  allow  the  attacker </p>
<p>to make a Shooting roll at –4 as above. Should </p>
<p>he hit, the target may make a simple Stealth roll </p>
<p>to ignore the attack (it misses).The Stealth roll is </p>
<p>made at –2 if the attack was made with a RoF of </p>
<p>3 or more.</p>
<p>Attack.Modifiers</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Cover:</b> Attackers  suffer  a  penalty  when </p>
<p>attempting to hit a target behind cover:</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Light  Cover: </b> Characters  subtract  1  from </p>
<p>their attack rolls if half or less of their target </p>
<p>is obscured.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Medium Cover: </b>The penalty is increased to </p>
<p>–2 if more than half of the target is hidden from </p>
<p>view. This is the usual penalty for attacking a </p>
<p>prone character (see <b>Prone</b>).</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Heavy Cover: </b>The penalty is –4 if only a small </p>
<p>part of the target is visible (prone beside a tree, </p>
<p>behind a high wall, peeking around the corner </p>
<p>of a building, etc.).</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Near Total Cover:</b> Attacking through a very </p>
<p>tight opening that provides near total cover, </p>
<p>such as an arrow slit, subtracts 6 from enemy </p>
<p>attack rolls.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Illumination:</b> Attacking  a  poorly-illuminated </p>
<p>target is more difficult than a similar attack with </p>
<p>good lighting, and incurs the following penalties:</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Dim:  Twilight,  light  fog,  night  with  a </b></p>
<p><b>full  moon,  and  so  on  subtract  1  from </b></p>
<p><b>combatants’ attack rolls.</b></p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Dark:</b> Normal darkness with some ambient light </p>
<p>(starlight, partial moon) inflicts a –2 penalty, and </p>
<p>targets aren’t visible outside of 10”.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Pitch Darkness: </b>Targets aren’t visible at all </p>
<p>in pitch blackness, but if a character knows </p>
<p>roughly where a victim is (he can hear him, </p>
<p>target is in a confined space, a glint of light </p>
<p>shines off his blade, etc.), he may be attacked </p>
<p>at –4.</p>
<p>Damage</p>
<p>After a successful close combat or ranged hit, </p>
<p>the attacker rolls damage. Ranged weapons do </p>
<p>fixed damage as listed in the Gear section. Most </p>
<p>pistols, for example, cause 2d6 damage.</p>
<p>Hand  weapons  cause  damage  equal  to  the </p>
<p>attacker’s Strength die plus a second die, which </p>
<p>depends on the weapon. A barbarian with a d12 </p>
<p>Strength  and  a  long  sword  (d8  damage)  rolls </p>
<p>d12+d8 damage. Even though Strength is used </p>
<p>to determine melee damage, this isn’t a Trait roll. </p>
<p>Wild Cards don’t add a Wild Die to the roll and </p>
<p>they can’t spend Bennies if they’re unhappy with </p>
<p>the results.</p>
<p>All damage rolls can Ace.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Unarmed  Combat  Damage:</b> An  unarmed </p>
<p>combatant rolls only his Strength die.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Bonus  Damage:</b>  Well-placed  attacks  are </p>
<p>more  likely  to  hit  vital  areas,  and  so  do  more </p>
<p>damage. If your hero gets a raise on his attack roll </p>
<p>(regardless of how <i>many</i> raises),<i> </i>he adds +1d6 to </p>
<p>the final total. This roll may also Ace!</p>
<p>Applying.Damage</p>
<p>The damage of an attack is compared to the </p>
<p>victim’s Toughness just like a Trait roll (though it </p>
<p>isn’t one so you can’t spend a Benny on it). With </p>
<p>a success, the victim is Shaken. For each raise </p>
<p>over his Toughness he suffers a wound as well, </p>
<p>as shown below:</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Success:</b>  The  character  is  Shaken.  If  he </p>
<p>was already Shaken, he suffers a wound and </p>
<p>remains Shaken. To cause a wound, the latter </p>
<p>Shaken  result  must  come  from  a  physical </p>
<p>attack  of  some  kind—not  a Test  of  Wills  or </p>
<p>other maneuver.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Raise:</b>  The  character  suffers  a  wound  for </p>
<p>every raise on the damage roll, and is Shaken. </p>
<p>(When wounds are caused, it doesn’t matter if </p>
<p>the victim was already Shaken beforehand.)</p>
<p><i><b>Example:</b> A barbarian hits an ogre with a </i></p>
<p><i>Toughness of 11. The barbarian’s friend, a </i></p>
<p><i>rogue, has already taunted the beast (a Test </i></p>
<p><i>of Wills, see page 86) and Shaken it.</i></p>
<p><i>If the barbarian’s damage is 11-14, that’s a </i></p>
<p><i>success and would normally Shake the ogre. </i></p>
<p><i>Since it’s already Shaken, he suffers a wound </i></p>
<p><i>and remains Shaken.</i></p>
<p><i>If the barbarian’s damage is 15+—a raise or </i></p>
<p><i>more—he’d simply cause wounds. The ogre </i></p>
<p><i>is already Shaken, and since a wound was </i></p>
<p><i>caused, there’s no further effect.</i></p>

<p>Game.Rules</p>
<p>Design.Note.-.Up,.Down,.or.Off.the.Table</p>
<p><i>One  of  the  core  principles  of  Savage </i></p>
<p><i>Worlds is that figures are up, down, or off </i></p>
<p><i>the table. This assumes you’re using figures, </i></p>
<p><i>but the concept applies even if you’re not. </i></p>
<p><i>Up, down, or off the table means the Game </i></p>
<p><i>Master  can  have  dozens  of  actors  (allies, </i></p>
<p><i>enemies, etc.) and easily keep track of them </i></p>
<p><i>all because those that are up are fine and </i></p>
<p><i>operating normally, those that are down are </i></p>
<p><i>Shaken,  and  those  who  are  Incapacitated </i></p>
<p><i>are removed. Understanding that may help </i></p>
<p><i>you better understand why the Shaken rules </i></p>
<p><i>work the way they do. </i></p>
<p><i>Of course the Game Master shouldn’t fill </i></p>
<p><i>the table with miniatures simply because he </i></p>
<p><i>can. Instead, the ability to handle such large </i></p>
<p><i>fights is a tool to let the player characters </i></p>
<p><i>adopt  different  strategies  than  they  would </i></p>
<p><i>in most games where this just isn’t practical. </i></p>
<p><i>Want to recruit a warband to help you take </i></p>
<p><i>down that orc horde? No problem! Want to </i></p>
<p><i>add several platoons of tanks to help storm </i></p>
<p><i>that enemy trench? Can do! One of our most </i></p>
<p><i>infamous convention scenarios is a dozen </i></p>
<p><i>tanks and 50 soldiers per side supporting a </i></p>
<p><i>raid by the player characters—all handled </i></p>
<p><i>in about two hours with roleplaying, puzzle-</i></p>
<p><i>solving, and a massive combat. The power </i></p>
<p><i>and flexibility to do that, while still maintaining </i></p>
<p><i>a high level of character customization and </i></p>
<p><i>detail, is one of the features we think makes </i></p>
<p><i>Savage Worlds so special.</i></p>
<p>Damage.Effects</p>
<p>Damage  can  result  in  three  effects:  Shaken, </p>
<p>wounds, and Incapacitation.</p>
<p>Shaken</p>
<p>If the damage of an attack is a simple success </p>
<p>(0-3 points over Toughness), the target is Shaken. </p>
<p>Shaken  characters  are  rattled,  distracted,  or </p>
<p>momentarily  shocked. They  aren’t  stunned  but </p>
<p>are temporarily suppressed enough that they must </p>
<p>make a Spirit roll to be effective.</p>
<p>On  their  action,  a  Shaken  character  must </p>
<p>attempt to recover from being Shaken by making </p>
<p>a Spirit roll:</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Failure:</b> The character remains Shaken. He </p>
<p>can only perform free actions (see page 75).</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Success:</b> The character is no longer Shaken, </p>
<p>but can still only perform free actions.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Raise:</b> The character is no longer Shaken and </p>
<p>may act normally.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Spending  Bennies:</b> A  player  may  spend  a </p>
<p>Benny at any time to remove his Shaken status. If </p>
<p>it’s currently his action, he may act as if he gained </p>
<p>a raise on the Spirit roll.</p>
<p>Wounds</p>
<p>Every raise on the damage roll inflicts a wound.</p>
<p>Wounded Extras are removed from play. They’re </p>
<p>dead, injured, or otherwise out of the fight.</p>
<p>Wild  Cards  can  take  three  wounds  and  still </p>
<p>function. If another wound would be caused after </p>
<p>that, they’re Incapacitated (see below). Wild Cards </p>
<p>never have more than three wounds—anything </p>
<p>beyond that is just considered three wounds and </p>
<p>Incapacitated (see below).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Wound Penalties: </b>Each wound a Wild Card </p>
<p>suffers causes a –1 cumulative penalty to his Pace </p>
<p>(minimum of 1) and to all further Trait tests—up to </p>
<p>the maximum of a hero’s 3 wounds. A hero with 2 </p>
<p>wounds, for example, suffers a –2 penalty to his </p>
<p>Pace and any Trait tests.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Timing:</b> Characters sometimes take multiple </p>
<p>hits  on  the  same Action  Card.  Resolve  each </p>
<p>damage  roll  separately  and  completely  before </p>
<p>moving on to the next (including any Soak rolls).</p>
<p>Incapacitation</p>
<p>Incapacitated  characters  aren’t  necessarily </p>
<p>dead,  but  are  generally  too  beaten,  battered, </p>
<p>or bruised to do anything useful. They may not </p>
<p>perform actions and are not dealt Action Cards </p>
<p>in  combat.  Incapacitated  Extras  are  removed </p>
<p>from play. </p>
<p>Wild Cards are Incapacitated if they suffer more </p>
<p>than three wounds (cumulatively or all at once). </p>
<p>When a Wild Card becomes Incapacitated, make </p>
<p>an immediate Vigor roll:</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Total of 1 or Less:</b> The character dies.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Failure:</b> Roll on the Injury Table. The Injury </p>
<p>is permanent and the victim is Bleeding Out </p>
<p>(see below).</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Success:</b> Roll on the Injury Table. The Injury </p>
<p>goes away when all wounds are healed.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Raise:</b>  Roll  on  the  Injury Table. The  Injury </p>
<p>goes away in 24 hours, or when all wounds </p>
<p>are healed.</p>

<p><i>Brain Damage:</i> Massive trauma </p>
<p>to the head. Smarts reduced one die </p>

<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Bleeding  Out:</b> The  injured  character  must </p>
<p>make a Vigor roll at the start of each round after </p>
<p>the one in which he was injured and before Action </p>
<p>Cards are dealt:</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Success:</b>  The  victim  must  roll  again  next </p>
<p>round,  or  every  minute  thereafter  if  not  in </p>
<p>combat.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Raise:</b> The  victim  stabilizes  and  no  further </p>
<p>rolls are required.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Failure:</b> The character dies from blood loss. </p>
<p>Other characters may stop a victim’s bleeding </p>
<p>by making a Healing roll. If successful, the victim </p>
<p>stabilizes immediately and no further rolls are </p>
<p>required. This use of the Healing skill just stops </p>
<p>the bleeding. See page 87 for the use of the </p>
<p>Healing skill to recover actual wounds.</p>
<p>Soak.Rolls</p>
<p>A  character  may  spend  a  Benny  to  make  a </p>
<p>“Soak”  roll,  which  is  a  Vigor  check. A  success </p>
<p>and each raise reduces the number of wounds </p>
<p>suffered from that attack by one.</p>
<p>If the character Soaks <i>all</i> of the wounds from </p>
<p>an  attack,  he  removes  his  Shaken  condition </p>
<p>too (even from a previous source). Don’t count </p>
<p>the wound  modifiers  he’s <i>about</i> to suffer when </p>
<p>making this roll.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Timing: </b>A character may only make one Soak </p>
<p>roll  per  attack.  If  a  Soak  roll  eliminates  2  of  3 </p>
<p>wounds, for instance, a hero can’t make another </p>
<p>Soak roll to eliminate the third wound. (The hero </p>
<p><i>could</i> spend a second Benny to reroll the Vigor </p>
<p>roll as usual, however.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Shaken:</b> A character can also spend a Benny </p>
<p>to immediately eliminate a Shaken condition (and </p>
<p>act  if  it’s  his  action). This  can  be  done  at  any </p>
<p>time—even just after a failed Spirit roll to recover.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--79</p>
<p>Situational.Combat.Rules</p>
<p>Below  are  a  number  of  rules  for  special </p>
<p>maneuvers  characters  might  perform  during </p>
<p>furious combat.</p>
<p>Aim</p>
<p>A character who spends a full round aiming (no </p>
<p>movement allowed) may add +2 to his Shooting </p>
<p>or Throwing  roll  in  the  following  round  versus </p>
<p>whatever he aimed at (a person, vehicle, etc.). </p>
<p>Aiming for multiple rounds has no extra effect.</p>
<p>Area.Effect.Attacks</p>
<p>Grenades, spell effects, and other attacks that </p>
<p>cover a large area are “area effect attacks.” The </p>
<p>three most common size attacks have been made </p>
<p>into Small, Medium, and Large Burst Templates, </p>
<p>found on page 180 and on our website.</p>
<p>To  attack  with  an  area  effect  weapon,  the </p>
<p>character  places  the  template  on  the  table  (or </p>
<p>picks where he wants the center of the blast to </p>
<p>be) and makes a Shooting or Throwing roll. If the </p>
<p>attack is successful, the blast is centered where </p>
<p>desired. Everything under (or partially under) the </p>
<p>template is affected, rolling damage separately </p>
<p>for each Wild Card or group of Extras.</p>
<p>Failure means the blast deviates. Just how far </p>
<p>depends on whether it was thrown or launched, </p>
<p>and what range bracket the target was in (Short, </p>
<p>Medium, or Long). Roll 1d6” for thrown weapons </p>
<p>(such as grenades) and 1d10” for fired projectiles. </p>
<p>Multiply by 1 for Short range, 2 for Medium, and </p>
<p>3 for Long.</p>
<p>Next roll a d12 and read it like a clock facing </p>
<p>to determine the direction the missile deviates. </p>
<p>A weapon can never deviate more than half the </p>
<p>distance to the original target. That keeps things </p>
<p>from going behind the thrower.</p>
<p>Targets  use  their  lowest  armor  value  against </p>
<p>area effect damage—armor must cover the entire </p>
<p>body without gaps to provide any protection at all.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Cover: </b> Targets  who  are  prone  or  behind </p>
<p>cover still get some protection from area effect </p>
<p>attacks. In these cases, the modifier they would </p>
<p>normally receive against ranged attacks acts as </p>
<p>that many points of Armor instead. A character in </p>
<p>major cover, like a foxhole, negates four points of </p>
<p>damage from a blast if he’s caught within it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Diving  for  Cover:</b> Thrown  weapons  with  a </p>
<p>blast effect (such as grenades) and artillery allow </p>
<p>potential  targets  a  chance  to  move  out  of  the </p>
<p>area of effect. Give targets who saw the danger </p>
<p>coming an Agility roll at –2 to jump out of the way </p>
<p>and avoid the damage. If successful, move the </p>
<p>character  just  outside  the  template  (his  choice </p>
<p>exactly where). Grenades can be thrown back as </p>
<p>well (see Grenades on page 57).</p>
<p>Automatic.Fire</p>
<p>Automatic  weapons  (those  with  an  RoF  of </p>
<p>2  or  higher)  fire  much  faster—and  inherently </p>
<p>differently—than regular firearms.</p>
<p>To attack with a full-auto weapon, roll a number </p>
<p>of Shooting dice equal to the weapon’s Rate of </p>
<p>Fire. Compare each die separately to the Target </p>
<p>Number to see if it hit. If the weapon has a RoF of </p>
<p>3, for example, a Wild Card rolls three Shooting </p>
<p>dice  plus  a  Wild  Die  and  uses  the  best  three </p>
<p>results.</p>
<p>Note that Wild Cards roll their Shooting dice plus </p>
<p>a Wild Die. They still can’t hit with more shots than </p>
<p>the weapon’s Rate of Fire, however.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Recoil:</b>  Fully  automatic  fire  is  typically </p>
<p>inaccurate because of the recoil between each </p>
<p>shot. Subtract 2 from the Shooting roll when firing </p>
<p>full-auto (ignore the penalty when firing a single </p>
<p>shot with such a weapon).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Full-Auto  and  Ammo: </b> This  system  is </p>
<p>somewhat abstract so that we don’t have to roll </p>
<p>dice for every single bullet (though we treat them </p>
<p>as  such  for  game  purposes). This  means  that </p>
<p>each die rolled on full-auto represents a number </p>
<p>of bullets equal to the weapon’s Rate of Fire when </p>
<p>counting  ammo,  even  though  only  one  “bullet” </p>
<p>can hit and cause damage from that die. Firing </p>
<p>all three dice with a Thompson gun (Rate of Fire </p>
<p>3), for example, consumes 9 bullets.</p>
<p>Most automatic weapons can be set to fire full-</p>
<p>auto or single shot. If a weapon has selectable </p>
<p>automatic use (Auto), you can fire a single shot </p>
<p>(and also ignore the full-auto penalty of –2).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Suppressive  Fire:</b>  Instead  of  attacking </p>
<p>specific targets, characters with fully  automatic </p>
<p>weapons can “spray” an area with lead in hopes </p>
<p>of  killing  or  suppressing  a  larger  number  of </p>
<p>victims. To suppress an area, the attacker places </p>
<p>the  Medium  Burst Template  on  the  battlefield </p>
<p>and makes a single Shooting roll (regardless of </p>
<p>the weapon’s Rate of Fire). Include the standard </p>
<p>modifiers  for  range,  the  full-auto  penalty,  and </p>
<p>any other miscellaneous factors, but ignore the </p>
<p>target’s modifiers if any (such as being prone or </p>
<p>in cover—these come into play in another way as </p>
<p>you’ll see below). If the attack misses, the spray </p>
<p>is off-target and has no effect.</p>
<p>If the attack is successful, all possible targets </p>
<p>within  the  area  make  Spirit  rolls,  adding  any </p>
<p>cover modifiers they would normally have against </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--80</p>
<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p>ranged  attacks  to  this  roll. Those  who  fail  are </p>
<p>Shaken. Those  who  roll  a  1  on  their  Spirit  die </p>
<p>(regardless of any Wild Dice) are actually hit by </p>
<p>the attack and suffer damage normally.</p>
<p>Suppressive fire uses five times the weapon’s </p>
<p>Rate  of  Fire  in  bullets. A  weapon  with  a  Rate </p>
<p>of  Fire  of  3,  for  example,  uses  15  bullets  for </p>
<p>suppressive fire.</p>
<p><i><b>Example:</b>  Buck  and  Virginia,  two  pulp-</i></p>
<p><i>era adventurers, are escaping from ancient </i></p>
<p><i>ruins in a stolen biplane. Suddenly, they’re </i></p>
<p><i>swarmed  by  an  evil  alligator  shaman  and </i></p>
<p><i>his brainwashed minions. Virginia spins the </i></p>
<p><i>plane’s  Maxim  gun  around  and  fires.  She </i></p>
<p><i>uses suppressive fire to slow them down. </i></p>
<p><i>She places a Medium Burst Template 16” </i></p>
<p><i>away—that’s Medium Range for the Maxim—</i></p>
<p><i>and rolls her Shooting. She gets a 13, –2 for </i></p>
<p><i>full-auto,  –2  for  an  unstable  platform  (the </i></p>
<p><i>plane), and –2 for Medium range, for a total </i></p>
<p><i>of 7. Success! The tribesmen in the template </i></p>
<p><i>must roll their Spirit or be Shaken. Those who </i></p>
<p><i>make it charge on through, but those who </i></p>
<p><i>roll a 1 are hit!</i></p>
<p>Breaking.Things</p>
<p>Occasionally  a  character  may  want  to  break </p>
<p>something, such as a weapon, a lock, or a door. </p>
<p>Use the Toughness values below for these kinds </p>
<p>of objects. Use these rules for solid objects. Larger </p>
<p>objects with many components (such as vehicles) </p>
<p>take multiple hits as per the vehicle rules.</p>
<p>Most  anything  can  be  broken  given  enough </p>
<p>time  and  effort,  so  use  this  system  only  when </p>
<p>attempting  to  break  things  in  a  hurry  (such  as </p>
<p>during combat rounds).</p>
<p>The  Parry  of  an  inanimate  object  is  2.  The </p>
<p>catch  is  that  damage  rolls  against  them  don’t </p>
<p>count  bonuses  from  raises  on  the  attack  roll, </p>
<p>nor Aces.  Unlike  a  person  or  even  a  vehicle, </p>
<p>an attack cannot hit a “vital” area on a lock or </p>
<p>a door and thus do more damage. If an attack </p>
<p>can’t do enough damage to destroy an object, it </p>
<p>can’t destroy it (at least not quickly). This keeps </p>
<p>characters from shattering swords with a feather </p>
<p>and a lucky Strength roll.</p>
<p>If  the  damage  roll  equals  or  exceeds  the </p>
<p>object’s Toughness, it’s broken, bent, shattered, </p>
<p>or otherwise ruined. The GM decides the exact </p>
<p>effects—such as whether a good strike opens a </p>
<p>hole in a door or knocks it off its hinges.</p>
<p>See <b>Obstacles</b> to attack <i>through</i> objects.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>

<p>Game.Rules</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Damage Types: </b>After the type of Object and </p>
<p>its Toughness is the type of damage that can affect </p>
<p>it. Swords do cutting or piercing damage, spears </p>
<p>are  piercing  weapons,  and  so  on.  Bullets  are </p>
<p>considered piercing weapons, though shotguns </p>
<p>do blunt damage at close range for the purpose </p>
<p>of this table.</p>
<p>The  type  of  damage  is  important  for  objects </p>
<p>because shooting a single bullet through a door, </p>
<p>for instance, may penetrate it, but won’t destroy </p>
<p>it. Only a blunt or cutting attack is likely to destroy </p>
<p>a door in one shot.</p>

<p>Called.Shots</p>
<p>Use the following modifiers and effects when </p>
<p>characters wish to target specific locations:</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Limb  (–2): </b> An  attack  to  a  limb  causes  no </p>
<p>additional  damage  but  may  ignore  armor </p>
<p>or  have  some  other  special  effect  (see  the </p>
<p><b>Disarm </b>maneuver).</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Head or Vitals (–4):</b> The attacker gains +4 </p>
<p>damage  from  a  successful  attack  to  these </p>
<p>critical areas. The target must actually have </p>
<p>vital areas, and the attacker must know where </p>
<p>they are to gain this advantage.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Small  Target  (–4):</b> Attacks  against  small </p>
<p>targets such as the heart of a vampire or a </p>
<p>missing scale on a large dragon’s chest are </p>
<p>made at –4. The effect of success depends on </p>
<p>the situation—the vampire might die instantly, </p>
<p>the missing scale may mean the dragon gets </p>
<p>no armor, etc. If the GM has no particular effect </p>
<p>in mind, it adds +4 damage just like a shot to </p>
<p>the head or vitals.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Tiny Target (–6):</b> Particularly small or narrow </p>
<p>targets,  such  as  the  eye-slit  of  a  knight’s </p>
<p>helmet, carry a –6 modifier. The effects of a </p>
<p>hit depend on the target. In the case of the </p>
<p>knight, the blow ignores armor and inflicts +4 </p>
<p>damage because it’s a head shot (as above).</p>
<p>Defend</p>
<p>If a character’s only regular action is to defend, </p>
<p>his  Parry  is  increased  by  +2  until  his  next </p>
<p>action. The defender may move normally while </p>
<p>performing this maneuver, but no running or other </p>
<p>actions are allowed.</p>
<p>Disarm</p>
<p>A character can try to make an opponent drop </p>
<p>a  weapon  (or  other  object)  with  either  a  close </p>
<p>combat or a ranged attack. To cause a disarm </p>
<p>check, the attacker must first hit the opponent’s </p>
<p>arm (–2, see <b>Called Shots</b>). The defender must </p>
<p>then make a Strength roll. If the roll is less than </p>
<p>the damage, he drops his weapon. The attacker </p>
<p>may choose to make this a nonlethal attack with a </p>
<p>melee weapon. Ranged attacks can be nonlethal </p>
<p>if the attacker targets the weapon instead of the </p>
<p>limb (generally –4 instead of –2).</p>
<p>Double.Taps.&amp;.Three.Round.Bursts</p>
<p>A character with a semi-automatic weapon (such </p>
<p>as a Colt .45, an M1 Carbine, or even an M16) can </p>
<p>fire two shots in one action by “double-tapping.” </p>
<p>Double tapping is a single Shooting roll that gives </p>
<p>the user +1 to hit and damage but expends two </p>
<p>rounds of ammunition.</p>
<p>Many modern automatic weapons, such as the </p>
<p>M16A2,  have  a  selector  switch  that  allows  the </p>
<p>user to go from single shot, to burst fire, to fully-</p>
<p>automatic as a free action. Burst fire, or a Three </p>
<p>Round burst, gives the user +2 to hit and damage, </p>
<p>and uses exactly three rounds of ammunition.</p>
<p>The.Drop</p>
<p>Sometimes an attacker is able to catch a foe </p>
<p>off-guard and gets “the drop” on him. This usually </p>
<p>happens  at  a  distance  of  only  a  few  feet,  but </p>
<p>other situations may occur (a sniper on a nearby </p>
<p>rooftop).</p>
<p>Only the GM can determine when one character </p>
<p>has obtained this kind of advantage over another. </p>
<p>Usually  it’s  when  the  victim  is  in  the  classic </p>
<p>hostage  pose,  is  completely  unaware  of  the </p>
<p>danger, or has been caught unarmed by an armed </p>
<p>foe. The attacker is considered on Hold and adds </p>
<p>+4 to his attack and damage rolls should he decide </p>
<p>to strike.</p>
<p>Finishing.Move</p>
<p>A  completely  helpless  victim  (bound, </p>
<p>unconscious,  etc.)  may  be  dispatched  with  a </p>
<p>lethal weapon of some sort as an action. This is </p>
<p>automatic unless the GM decides there’s a special </p>
<p>situation, such as a particularly tough or naturally </p>
<p>armored victim, a chance for escape, and so on.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--82</p>
<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p>The killer must usually dispatch his foe up close </p>
<p>and personal, but the GM may occasionally let </p>
<p>finishing moves be performed at range.</p>
<p>Firing.Into.Melee</p>
<p>Occasionally heroes have to fire into the middle </p>
<p>of hand-to-hand fights. The trouble is that even </p>
<p>though we might see figures standing perfectly </p>
<p>still on the table-top, in “reality,” they’re circling </p>
<p>each other, wrestling back and forth, and moving </p>
<p>erratically. For that reason, firing into a tangle of </p>
<p>people, such as a melee, is quite dangerous. Use </p>
<p>the <b>Innocent Bystander</b> rules when this occurs </p>
<p>(see below).</p>
<p>Full.Defense</p>
<p>In  addition  to  the  usual  Defend  option,  a </p>
<p>character can go for a full defensive action. He </p>
<p>makes a Fighting roll at +2 and uses the result </p>
<p>as his Parry until his next action. This is a trait </p>
<p>test, so he gets to roll his Wild Die as well. And, </p>
<p>of course, the dice can Ace, and you can choose </p>
<p>to use Bennies on the roll if you want to.</p>
<p>Note that the character’s Parry never gets worse </p>
<p>as a result of the roll. If the roll is lower than the </p>
<p>hero’s  Parry  score,  he  keeps  that  instead  (but </p>
<p>gains no bonus from the full defense).</p>
<p>A hero using the full defense maneuver cannot </p>
<p>move at all, however. He’s doing everything he </p>
<p>can to fend off whatever is attacking him. If he </p>
<p>wants  to  move  away  as  well,  use  the  Defend </p>
<p>maneuver instead.</p>
<p>Ganging.Up</p>
<p>Ganging up on a foe allows attackers to flank, </p>
<p>exploit  openings,  and  generally  harass  their </p>
<p>outnumbered opponent. Each additional adjacent </p>
<p>foe adds +1 to all the attackers’ Fighting rolls, up to </p>
<p>a maximum of +4. If three warriors attack a single </p>
<p>hero, for example, each of the three warriors gets </p>
<p>a +2 bonus to their Fighting rolls.</p>
<p>Grappling</p>
<p>Sometimes  it’s  best  to  restrain  an  opponent </p>
<p>rather than beat him to a bloody pulp. That’s where </p>
<p>grappling comes in.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--83</p>
<p>Game.Rules</p>
<p>Grappling is an opposed Fighting roll that causes </p>
<p>no damage. If the attacker wins, he’s entangled his </p>
<p>foe. With a raise, his foe is also Shaken.</p>
<p>Once entangled, the defender may attempt to </p>
<p>break free on his next action. Both the defender </p>
<p>and attacker pick either their Strength or Agility </p>
<p>and then an opposed roll is made. If successful, </p>
<p>the defender is free but the attempt consumes </p>
<p>his action. If he does so with a raise, he’s free </p>
<p>and may act normally. Failure means he is still </p>
<p>entangled. Instead of breaking free the defender </p>
<p>may attempt a different action but at a –4 penalty.</p>
<p>After  grappling,  the  attacker  may  attempt  to </p>
<p>damage  his  victim  on  subsequent  rounds  by </p>
<p>making an opposed roll as above. On a success </p>
<p>he does his Strength in damage (gaining the extra </p>
<p>d6 for a raise as normal).</p>
<p>Improvised.Weapons</p>
<p>Heroes  often  find  themselves  fighting  with </p>
<p>objects that aren’t intended for use as weapons. </p>
<p>Torches, vases, chairs, tankards, bottles, tools, </p>
<p>and other mundane items are frequently pressed </p>
<p>into service in combat. And sometimes characters </p>
<p>find  themselves  using  existing  weapons  in </p>
<p>improvised ways, defending with a ranged weapon </p>
<p>in melee or trying to throw a hand weapon not </p>
<p>designed to be thrown.</p>
<p>Such improvised weapons cause the wielder to </p>
<p>suffer a –1 Fighting or Throwing penalty, as well as </p>
<p>–1 to Parry. The Game Master is the final judge of </p>
<p>an improvised weapon’s effectiveness.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Small Weapons:</b> Range 3/6/12, Damage </p>
<p>Str+d4, RoF 1, Min Str d4, –1 attack and </p>
<p>Parry</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Medium Weapons:</b> Range 2/4/8, Damage </p>
<p>Str+d6, RoF 1, Min Str d6, –1 attack and </p>
<p>Parry</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Large Weapons:</b> Range 1/2/4, Damage </p>
<p>Str+d8, RoF 1, Min Str d8, –1 attack and </p>
<p>Parry</p>
<p>Innocent.Bystanders</p>
<p>When  an  attacker  misses  a  Shooting  or </p>
<p>Throwing  roll,  it  may  sometimes  be  important </p>
<p>to see if any other targets in the line of fire were </p>
<p>hit. The GM should only use this rule when it’s </p>
<p>dramatically  appropriate—not  for  every  missed </p>
<p>shot in a hail of gunfire.</p>
<p>Each miss that comes up a 1 on the Shooting </p>
<p>die indicates a random adjacent character was </p>
<p>hit. If the attacker was firing on full-auto or with a </p>
<p>shotgun, a roll of 1 or 2 hits the bystander. Roll </p>
<p>damage normally.</p>
<p>Horses and other animals are possible targets </p>
<p>when firing on mounted characters as well.</p>
<p>It’s sometimes easier to hit an adjacent victim </p>
<p>than the original target using this quick system. </p>
<p>That may not be entirely realistic, but it’s fast and </p>
<p>simple, it makes large groups of people vulnerable </p>
<p>to missile fire, and best of all, increases the drama </p>
<p>of firing at opponents locked in melee with the </p>
<p>attacker’s allies.</p>
<p>Mounted.Combat</p>
<p>Characters  fighting  from  horseback  (or  other </p>
<p>strange  beasts)  have  certain  advantages  and </p>
<p>disadvantages in combat, as described below.</p>
<p>Mounts aren’t dealt Action Cards—they act with </p>
<p>their riders. Animals specifically noted as being </p>
<p>trained to fight (such as warhorses) may attack </p>
<p>any threat to their front during their riders’ action. </p>
<p>Untrained horses do not fight unless riderless, and </p>
<p>even then usually only if cornered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Horsemanship:</b>  Characters  who  wish  to </p>
<p>fight from horseback must use the lowest of their </p>
<p>Fighting or Riding skills. This makes it important </p>
<p>for cavalrymen to actually be able to ride well!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Collisions:</b> If a mounted character runs into </p>
<p>something solid—such as a wall—both he and </p>
<p>the mount suffer Collision Damage as explained </p>
<p>in the Vehicle Rules on page 115.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Running:</b>  Riders  suffer  the  usual  running </p>
<p>penalty (–2) to attacks if the animal runs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Falling:</b> Anytime  a  character  is  Shaken  or </p>
<p>suffers  a  wound  while  on  horseback  he  must </p>
<p>make a Riding roll to stay horsed. If he fails, he </p>
<p>falls. If the horse is moving, the rider suffers 2d6 </p>
<p>damage (he’s merely Fatigued for the rest of the </p>
<p>fight if the horse was still).</p>
<p> </p>

<p><b>Firing on Mounted Targets:</b> Shots directed at </p>
<p>mounted characters use the Innocent Bystander </p>
<p>rules to see if the horse was hit. Of course, an </p>
<p>attacker can always aim for the horse instead.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Charging:</b> A rider on a charging horse adds </p>
<p>+4 to his damage roll with a successful Fighting </p>
<p>attack. To be considered charging, the rider must </p>
<p>have  moved  at  least  6”  or  more  in  a  relatively </p>
<p>straight line towards his foe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Setting Weapons:</b> A weapon with a Reach of </p>
<p>1 or greater can be “set” against a cavalry attack. </p>
<p>To do so, the attacker must be on Hold when he is </p>
<p>attacked by a charging mount (see above).</p>
<p>If  so,  he  rolls  to  interrupt  as  usual,  but  each </p>
<p>combatant adds +2 to his Agility roll for each point </p>
<p>of his weapon’s reach. The winner attacks first, </p>
<p>and adds the +4 charge bonus to his damage; the </p>
<p>loser gains no bonus.</p>

<p>►</p>
<p><b>Wounded  Mounts:</b>  When  an  animal  is </p>
<p>Shaken  or  wounded,  it  rears  or  bucks. A  rider </p>
<p>must make a Riding roll to stay mounted, or suffer </p>
<p>the consequences of falling (see above). Mounts </p>
<p>which aren’t trained in fighting flee in a random </p>
<p>direction  when  Shaken,  taking  their  riders  with </p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>Nonlethal.Damage</p>
<p>A  character  who  wants  to  beat  someone  up </p>
<p>without killing them can choose to do nonlethal </p>
<p>damage.  This  requires  the  attacker  use  only </p>
<p>his fists or a blunt weapon of some sort. Edged </p>
<p>weapons may be used if they have a flat side, but </p>
<p>this subtracts –1 from the attacker’s Fighting rolls. </p>
<p>Nonlethal  damage  causes  wounds  as  usual, </p>
<p>but if a character is rendered Incapacitated he’s </p>
<p>knocked out for 1d6 hours instead.</p>
<p>Nonlethal wounds are otherwise treated exactly </p>
<p>as lethal wounds. This means it’s much easier to </p>
<p>render an Extra unconscious than a Wild Card. </p>
<p>This is intentional, and should work well for most </p>
<p>genres where heroes can take multiple punches </p>
<p>before going down for the count, but most “mooks” </p>
<p>go out with one or two good punches. </p>
<p><i><b>Example:</b> Virginia is whacked on the head </i></p>
<p><i>by a cultist. The villain gets lucky and does </i></p>
<p><i>4 wounds to our heroine. Virginia rolls her </i></p>
<p><i>Vigor and gets a failure. Because he was </i></p>
<p><i>doing nonlethal damage, Virginia is simply </i></p>
<p><i>knocked out for 1d6 hours.</i></p>
<p>Obstacles</p>
<p>Sometimes  characters  have  sufficient  power </p>
<p>to attack their foes <i>through</i> obstacles. (See the </p>
<p><b>Breaking  Things</b>  section  to  actually  destroy </p>
<p>intervening obstacles.) To do so, first decide if the </p>
<p>attack hits. If it misses, there’s no additional effect </p>
<p>other than a small hole in the intervening obstacle.</p>
<p>If the attack would have hit without the cover </p>
<p>modifier, the round is on target but the obstacle </p>
<p>acts as armor for the target behind it. In the table </p>
<p>below are the Armor bonuses for some obstacles </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--85</p>
<p>Game.Rules</p>
<p>commonly used as cover. This is added directly to </p>
<p>the target’s Toughness, including any actual armor </p>
<p>he’s  wearing  in  the  affected  location.  Subtract </p>
<p>the weapon’s Armor Piercing value from the total </p>
<p>protection offered—not from <i>both </i>the obstacle and </p>
<p>armor actually worn by the target.</p>
<p><i><b>Example:</b>  A  soldier  blasts  an  Axis </i></p>
<p><i>abomination  hiding  behind  a  stone  wall </i></p>
<p><i>(Armor +10) with a bazooka. The bazooka </i></p>
<p><i>ignores 9 points of Armor, so the wall only </i></p>
<p><i>provides 1 point of protection.</i></p>

<p>Off-Hand.Attacks</p>
<p>Characters  are  assumed  to  be  right-handed </p>
<p>unless the player decides otherwise. Actions that </p>
<p>require precise eye-hand coordination, such as </p>
<p>Fighting or Shooting, suffer a –2 penalty when </p>
<p>done with the off-hand.</p>
<p>Prone</p>
<p>Smart heroes lie down when lead starts flying. </p>
<p>They  move,  shoot,  and  then  get  prone  behind </p>
<p>cover before their action is over, forcing attackers </p>
<p>to go on Hold to attack them. Prone gives them </p>
<p>Medium  Cover  against  most  attacks.  Ranged </p>
<p>attacks  within  3”  ignore  the  modifier  since  the </p>
<p>target is just as exposed as if he were standing </p>
<p>next to these characters. </p>
<p>If a prone defender is caught in melee, his Parry </p>
<p>is reduced by 2 and he must subtract 2 from his </p>
<p>Fighting rolls. Getting up from prone costs 2” of </p>
<p>movement.</p>
<p>Push</p>
<p>Sometimes characters may want to push a foe </p>
<p>in hopes of knocking him out of position, prone, or </p>
<p>even into a deadly hazard. This is called a Push.</p>
<p>To push a foe, the attacker and the target make </p>
<p>opposed Strength rolls. If successful, the attacker </p>
<p>has three choices. He can:</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Bash:</b> Push the target 1” for a success </p>
<p>and 2” on a raise on the Strength roll. If the </p>
<p>defender hits an obstacle, he suffers 1d6 </p>
<p>damage for every 1” he would have moved.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Shield Bash:</b> If the attacker has a shield, </p>
<p>he can push the attacker as above, but also </p>
<p>causes Str damage. Add +1 to the damage </p>
<p>for a small shield, +2 for a medium shield, </p>
<p>and +3 for a large shield.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Knock Prone:</b> The defender is knocked </p>
<p>prone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Running:</b> If the attacker ran at least 3” before </p>
<p>the push, he adds +2 to his roll.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Hazards:</b> The Game Master must determine </p>
<p>results from any other obstacles or hazards, such </p>
<p>as a cliff edge, wall of fire, etc.</p>
<p>Ranged.Weapons.in.Close.Combat</p>
<p>No  ranged  weapon  larger  than  a  pistol  may </p>
<p>be  fired  at  adjacent  foes  engaged  in  melee. </p>
<p>Larger weapons may be used as clubs, however. </p>
<p>Pistols can be fired in close combat, but since the </p>
<p>defender is actively fighting back, the TN for the </p>
<p>Shooting roll is his Parry rather than the standard </p>
<p>TN of 4.</p>
<p>That means it’s harder to hit someone who’s </p>
<p>wrestling  with  your  character  in  melee  than </p>
<p>someone a few feet further away who isn’t actively </p>
<p>wrestling with your hero.</p>
<p>Rapid.Attack</p>
<p>Sometimes  an  outnumbered  fighter  needs  to </p>
<p>sacrifice skill for blind luck. A rapid attack is a wild </p>
<p>swing of the blade or a hasty spray of shots that </p>
<p>favors fortune over expertise. Both the melee and </p>
<p>ranged version inflict a –2 penalty to Parry.</p>
<p>In  melee,  the  warrior  can  make  up  to  three </p>
<p>attacks as a single action. Roll a Fighting die for </p>
<p>each, and subtract –4 for the totals (Wild Cards </p>
<p>get a Wild Die as usual).</p>
<p>Ranged  attackers  with  a  semi-automatic </p>
<p>weapon or revolver may fire up to six shots at a </p>
<p>–4 penalty to each. Roll a Shooting die for each </p>
<p>shot (along with the Wild Die if the attacker is a </p>
<p>Wild Card). Single action revolvers refer to this </p>
<p>maneuver as “fanning the hammer,” and it requires </p>
<p>two hands to perform.</p>
<p>Rapid attack cannot be combined with any other </p>
<p>effect that allows attacking multiple foes in one </p>
<p>action (Sweep, Frenzy, Autofire, Two Weapons, </p>
<p>etc.), nor may it be used with a Double Tap or </p>
<p>Three Round Burst.</p>
<p>The rapid attack must be taken all at once but </p>
<p>the warrior can assign his skill dice to multiple </p>
<p>targets if he chooses.</p>

<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p>Tests.of.Will</p>
<p>Intimidation and Taunt allow a character to make </p>
<p>a “Test of Wills” attack against an opponent. In </p>
<p>combat situations or during competitive miniature </p>
<p>battles,  Tests  of  Will  have  objective  effects, </p>
<p>as  seen  below.  More  subjective  effects  are </p>
<p>determined by the Game Master in roleplaying </p>
<p>situations.</p>
<p>To make a Test of Wills, the character makes </p>
<p>an opposed roll against his chosen target. The </p>
<p>defender uses Smarts to resist Taunt, and Spirit </p>
<p>to resist Intimidation.</p>
<p>The Game Master should modify both character’s </p>
<p>rolls depending on the situation. Waving a gun in </p>
<p>someone’s face isn’t polite, but it’s definitely worth </p>
<p>a +2 bonus to Intimidation, for example (unless </p>
<p>the target has an even bigger gun!).</p>
<p>A success means the attacker gets a +2 bonus </p>
<p>to his next action against the defender during this </p>
<p>combat. A raise on the roll gives the attacker the </p>
<p>bonus and makes the defender Shaken as well. </p>
<p>This can be a great setup for an attack, a trick, or </p>
<p>even a second Test of Wills if the first one didn’t </p>
<p>get a Shaken result.</p>

<p>Spirit</p>
<p><i><b>Example:</b>  Buck  Savage  tries  to  Taunt  a </i></p>
<p><i>crocodile cultist by flipping his machete and </i></p>
<p><i>grinning like a hyena. He rolls his Taunt and </i></p>
<p><i>beats the warrior’s Smarts with a raise. The </i></p>
<p><i>cultist is Shaken and Buck adds +2 to his next </i></p>
<p><i>action against the spearman.</i></p>
<p>Touch.Attack</p>
<p>A character who simply wants to touch a foe </p>
<p>(usually to deliver a magical effect of some kind) </p>
<p>may add +2 to his Fighting roll.</p>
<p>Tricks</p>
<p>Heroes  often  attempt  fancy  maneuvers  or </p>
<p>clever tricks to distract their foes and set them up </p>
<p>for deadly follow-up attacks. This might include </p>
<p>throwing  sand  in  an  opponent’s  eyes,  ducking </p>
<p>between a tall foe’s legs to stab him in the back, </p>
<p>and so on. Tricks do not include weapon feints—</p>
<p>those  are  already  “assumed”  in  a  character’s </p>
<p>Fighting and Parry scores.</p>
<p>To  perform  the  trick,  the  player  must  first </p>
<p>describe exactly what his character is doing. Next </p>
<p>he makes an opposed Agility or Smarts roll against </p>
<p>his foe. The GM must determine which is more </p>
<p>appropriate based on the player’s description of </p>
<p>the maneuver.</p>
<p>If the character is successful, his opponent is </p>
<p>distracted  and  suffers  –2  to  his  Parry  until  his </p>
<p>next action. With a raise, the foe is distracted and </p>
<p>Shaken as well.</p>
<p>These  penalties  do  not  stack. Tricking  a  foe </p>
<p>twice has no additional effect.</p>
<p><i><b>Example: </b>Buck is backed into a corner by </i></p>
<p><i>a very large and dangerous thug. Our hero </i></p>
<p><i>pulls the oldest trick in the book. He says “Hi </i></p>
<p><i>Virginia!” and pretends to smile at someone </i></p>
<p><i>behind his less-than-brilliant foe. He and the </i></p>
<p><i>thug both make Smarts rolls, and Buck wins </i></p>
<p><i>with a raise. The thug swirls about, expecting </i></p>
<p><i>an attack from behind, and is momentarily </i></p>
<p><i>Shaken. The unfortunate goon also suffers </i></p>
<p><i>–2 to his Parry until his next action, giving </i></p>
<p><i>Buck time for a quick rabbit punch that just </i></p>
<p><i>might put the big fellow down.</i></p>
<p>Two.Weapons</p>
<p>A character may attack with a weapon in each </p>
<p>hand if he desires. This works just like any other </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--87</p>
<p>multi-action,  and  inflicts  a  –2  penalty  to  each </p>
<p>attack. (Note that the Two-Fisted Edge negates </p>
<p>the multi-action penalty when attacking with two </p>
<p>weapons.)</p>
<p>Unless your hero has the Ambidextrous Edge, </p>
<p>subtract  another  2  points  from  the  off-handed </p>
<p>attack  (see  Off-Hand Attacks). A  hero  with  the </p>
<p>Frenzy Edge adds the additional die with either </p>
<p>melee attack of his choice.</p>
<p><i><b>Example:</b> A warrior is backed into a corner </i></p>
<p><i>by a pack of ravenous dire wolves. He has </i></p>
<p><i>two  short  swords  but  isn’t Ambidextrous. </i></p>
<p><i>The first roll suffers a –2 penalty (for using </i></p>
<p><i>two  weapons),  and  the  second  suffers  a </i></p>
<p><i>–4 penalty (the multi-action penalty for two </i></p>
<p><i>weapons  plus  the  off-hand  penalty).  He </i></p>
<p><i>makes his Fighting roll twice, and gets his </i></p>
<p><i>Wild Die with each roll.</i></p>
<p>Unarmed.Defender</p>
<p>If one character has a melee weapon and his </p>
<p>foe doesn’t, the opponent is considered unarmed </p>
<p>and is very likely in a world of hurt. Since he can </p>
<p>only  dodge  and  evade  rather  than  parry,  any </p>
<p>armed attacker trying to hit him may add +2 to his </p>
<p>Fighting roll. Nearly all animals and monsters are </p>
<p>considered armed due to natural weapons such </p>
<p>as claws and teeth.</p>
<p>Unstable.Platform</p>
<p>A character attempting to fire a ranged attack </p>
<p>from the back of a horse or other mount, a moving </p>
<p>vehicle, or other “unstable platform” suffers –2 to </p>
<p>his Shooting roll.</p>
<p>Wild.Attack</p>
<p>Sometimes  a  desperate  character  may  want </p>
<p>to  throw  caution  to  the  wind  and  attack  with </p>
<p>everything he’s got. This is called a “wild attack,” </p>
<p>and can be devastating if used correctly. If used </p>
<p>recklessly,  it  can  quickly  get  even  a  veteran </p>
<p>character slaughtered.</p>
<p>Performing  a  wild  attack  adds  +2  to  the </p>
<p>character’s Fighting attack and resulting damage </p>
<p>roll, but his Parry is reduced by 2 until his next </p>
<p>action.</p>
<p>Wild attacks can be used with multiple attacks, </p>
<p>such as from the Frenzy or Sweep Edges, or with </p>
<p>two weapons.</p>
<p>Withdrawing.From.Close.Combat</p>
<p>Inevitably,  your  hero  will  decide  discretion  is </p>
<p>the  better  part  of  valor.  Whenever  a  character </p>
<p>retreats  from  melee,  all  adjacent  non-Shaken </p>
<p>opponents get an immediate free attack (but only </p>
<p>one—no Frenzy or other Edges apply unless they </p>
<p>specifically say otherwise).</p>
<p>A  character  may  take  the  Defend  option  (+2 </p>
<p>Parry) while retreating from combat, but won’t be </p>
<p>able to perform other actions that round besides </p>
<p>movement and still suffers the free attack.</p>
<p><i><b>Example: </b> Inspector  Mars  is  attacked  by </i></p>
<p><i>three  cultists  in  melee.  He  decides  to  run </i></p>
<p><i>for it, giving each cultist a free Fighting roll </i></p>
<p><i>against  him.  Mars  wisely  uses  the  Defend </i></p>
<p><i>maneuver as well to increase his Parry by </i></p>
<p><i>+2 until he can get away.</i></p>
<p>Healing</p>
<p>The Healing skill can be used to treat any wound </p>
<p>suffered within the last hour. Each attempt takes </p>
<p>10 minutes.</p>
<p>A  character  may  only  attempt  to  heal  fresh </p>
<p>wounds on a given patient once within the hour </p>
<p>they were  sustained. A  different  character may </p>
<p>attempt a Healing roll, but once attempted, that </p>
<p>healer  has  done  all  he  can  for  that  particular </p>
<p>patient.</p>
<p>A success on a Healing roll removes one wound, </p>
<p>and a raise removes two. Further raises have no </p>
<p>effect.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Modifiers:</b>  The  healer  must  subtract  the </p>
<p>patient’s  wound  levels  from  his  skill  roll. A </p>
<p>wounded character trying to heal his own injuries </p>
<p>suffers  from  both  effects  (his  wounds  plus  the </p>
<p>wound penalty to the Healing roll).</p>
<p>Healing requires some basic supplies such as </p>
<p>bandages and reasonably clean water. If these </p>
<p>aren’t available, the healer suffers a –2 penalty </p>
<p>to his roll.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>The Golden Hour: </b>After one hour, only natural </p>
<p>healing or the <i>greater healing</i> power can help.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Incapacitated  Patients: </b> If  a  victim  is </p>
<p>Incapacitated the healer must first make a Healing </p>
<p>roll to remove that state, He may then attempt </p>
<p>further Healing rolls to remove actual wounds.</p>
<p>Design.Note.-.The.Golden.Hour</p>
<p><i>In the real world, paramedics have a term </i></p>
<p><i>called  “the  Golden  Hour.”  Patients  who </i></p>
<p><i>survive  their  initial  trauma  have  about  an </i></p>
<p><i>hour to survive most life-threatening injuries. </i></p>
<p><i>If they receive medical attention during that </i></p>
<p><i>time, they can generally be saved. The longer </i></p>
<p><i>the wait, however, the more likely the wounds </i></p>
<p><i>are to be fatal.</i></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--88</p>
<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p><i>In Savage Worlds, we extend this concept </i></p>
<p><i>to healing in general. A medic who can treat </i></p>
<p><i>a wound within the first hour can typically </i></p>
<p><i>negate  some  of  its  ill  effects.  Besides </i></p>
<p><i>reflecting  the  real-world  concept,  it  also </i></p>
<p><i>provides  good  game  balance  and  drama. </i></p>
<p><i>If the party could simply retry Healing rolls </i></p>
<p><i>over and over at any time, their group would </i></p>
<p><i>never experience the drama of being beaten </i></p>
<p><i>up by the bad guys, then deciding whether </i></p>
<p><i>or not to seek shelter and rest up, or striving </i></p>
<p><i>on despite their gruesome wounds.</i></p>
<p>Natural.Healing</p>
<p>Every  five  days,  wounded  or  Incapacitated </p>
<p>characters  may  make  Vigor  rolls.  Wild  Cards </p>
<p>remove one wound level (or their Incapacitated </p>
<p>status) with a success, or improve two steps with </p>
<p>a raise. A critical failure on a natural healing roll </p>
<p>increases a Wild Card’s wound level by one. If </p>
<p>the hero already has three wounds he becomes </p>
<p>Incapacitated.  Extras  lose  their  Incapacitated </p>
<p>status with a success and expire if they roll a 1 </p>
<p>on their Vigor die.</p>
<p>Subtract wound penalties from  these  rolls as </p>
<p>usual,  as  well  as  any  of  the  modifiers  below. </p>
<p>These  are  cumulative,  so  rough  traveling  in </p>
<p>intense cold with one wound is a total penalty of </p>
<p>–5, for example.</p>
<p>Medical  attention  means  that  someone  with </p>
<p>the Healing skill is actively checking the patient’s </p>
<p>wounds,  changing  dressings,  giving  what </p>
<p>medicines  are  available,  and  generally  looking </p>
<p>after the patient’s well-being.</p>

<p>Aftermath</p>
<p>It’s  often  important to know  what  happens to </p>
<p>Extras  who  were  Incapacitated  during  a  fight. </p>
<p>This creates interesting choices for the players </p>
<p>after battle as they must decide what to do with </p>
<p>their wounded companions and living captives. Do </p>
<p>they leave their men behind? Do they slaughter </p>
<p>their foes? These situations should present your </p>
<p>group with chances to roleplay their characters, </p>
<p>and challenges to their overall plans as they have </p>
<p>to deal with prisoners or walking wounded.</p>
<p>After a fight, the players make Vigor rolls for </p>
<p>all of their wounded allies and the GM rolls for </p>
<p>wounded foes. With a success, the Extra is alive </p>
<p>but Incapacitated (failure indicates death). With </p>
<p>a raise, the wounds were only superficial and the </p>
<p>character may function normally.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Walking Wounded: </b>If it becomes important </p>
<p>to know which Incapacitated characters can walk </p>
<p>and which cannot, make a second Vigor roll for </p>
<p>each. Those who make it are “walking wounded”—</p>
<p>they may shamble slowly but still cannot fight or </p>
<p>perform other useful actions.</p>
<p>Those who don’t make the roll can be moved </p>
<p>but  risk  aggravating  their  injuries.  They  must </p>
<p>make another Vigor roll for each and every hour </p>
<p>of movement. Should they fail, they begin to die. </p>

<p>Extended.Combat.Example</p>
<p>The heroes are two soldiers in a Weird Wars: Vietnam campaign—Lt. Griffith and Private Daniels. </p>
<p>While on patrol, they’re attacked by a pack of ravenous walking dead. The Game Master goes to </p>
<p>combat rounds and deals out Action Cards. He draws a Ten of Clubs for the zombies. Lt. Griffith draws </p>
<p>a Jack of Spades. Private Daniels has the Quick Edge and draws a Two of Clubs. That’s too low so </p>
<p>he draws again and gets a Joker!</p>
<p>Private.Dan’–.Joker</p>
<p>Dan whips out a grenade and places the Medium Burst Template directly over three of the zombies. </p>
<p>They’re in Short Range so there are no penalties to the roll. The Joker gives him a +2 and his Throwing </p>
<p>is d6. He rolls a 6, which is an Ace. He rolls again and gets a 4. That’s 6+4+2 for the Joker, or 12. He </p>
<p>hits with a raise over the standard TN of 4. Grenades cause 3d6 damage, and 4d6 with the raise. After </p>
<p>Acing and adding all the dice together, he gets a 23. That’s far more than a raise over the zombies’ </p>
<p>Toughness 7, so that’s a wound to each. They’re Extras so that’s all they can take and all three are </p>
<p>wiped out.</p>
<p>Lt..Griffith.–.Jack.of.Spades</p>
<p>Lt. Griffith now fires full-auto and decides to split his shots between zombies G, F, and E. His Shooting </p>
<p>is d6 and he has an M-16. He doesn’t have the Rock n’ Roll Edge so his shots are at –2. His TN at </p>
<p>Short Range is 4, so with the –2 he needs to roll 6 or better on each of his dice.</p>
<p>The first two dice are misses. The third die is an Ace (6) so he rolls again and gets another Ace </p>
<p>(6). He rolls once more and gets a 4 for a total of 16, minus two for full-auto is 14. A hit with a raise </p>
<p>on Zombie E. The Lt.’s Wild Die also Aces and winds up with a grand total of 6. He chooses to use </p>
<p>that on Zombie F.</p>
<p>Lt. Griffith rolls the hit on Zombie F first. Damage on an M-16 is 2d8. He rolls the dice together and </p>
<p>gets a total of 9. That exceeds the zombie’s Toughness of 7 but isn’t a raise, so it’s Shaken.</p>
<p>Now Lt. Griffith rolls the hit with the raise on Zombie E. The damage is 2d8 plus a d6 for the raise. </p>
<p>Griffith rolls a 4, an 8, and a 6. He rolls both the 8 and the 6 again since those are both Aces and </p>
<p>gets a 2 on both dice. That’s (4+8+6+2+2=) 20! That’s a raise over the zombie’s Toughness so it’s </p>
<p>blasted to pieces.</p>
<p>The.Zombies.—.Ten.of.Clubs</p>
<p>Now the zombies go. Zombie F is Shaken and makes a Spirit roll at +2 for being undead. It gets </p>
<p>a total of 7, so it’s unShaken but cannot act. It can move, however, so it shambles into contact with </p>
<p>Private Dan.</p>
<p>Zombies D and G also move into contact with Private Dan. Since Zombie F is in contact, this gives </p>
<p>them +2 on their Fighting rolls due to the Gang Up Bonus (page 73). Zombie D misses but G gets a </p>
<p>total of 6 and Dan’s Parry is 5, so that’s a hit. It does Str+d4 with its claws. It’s Strength is a d6, so the </p>
<p>GM rolls a d6+d4 and gets a 5. Dan’s Toughness is 5, so he’s Shaken.</p>
<p>Round.Two</p>
<p>The GM shuffles the deck because Dan got a Joker, then deals new Action Cards. Lt. Griffith gets a </p>
<p>lousy Two of Clubs. The zombies get an Ace of Diamonds, and Dan gets an Ace of Clubs. Diamonds </p>
<p>go before Clubs, so the zombies act first.</p>
<p>Zombies.—.Ace.of.Diamonds</p>
<p>All the zombies can now attack, and give each other +2 to their Fighting rolls since they’re ganging </p>
<p>up on the private. Zombie D misses with a 1. Zombie G gets a 5, +2 for ganging up for a total of 7. </p>
<p>That’s regular damage of Str+d4, and it gets a total of 6. Since Dan is already Shaken, that causes </p>
<p>a wound and he remains Shaken.</p>
<p>Zombie F now gets really lucky. It hits with a raise and rolls15 damage. Every raise over Dan’s </p>
<p>Toughness is a wound, so that’s two wounds. He already has one from Zombie G, so that brings him </p>
<p>to three wounds total. He’s already Shaken so that doesn’t change.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--91</p>
<p>Private.Dan.—.Ace.of.Clubs</p>
<p>Dan fails his Spirit roll and can’t act. He doesn’t move out of combat either or the zombies will get </p>
<p>free attacks on him (page 76).</p>
<p>Lt..Griffith.—.Two.of.Clubs</p>
<p>It’s all up to Lt. Griffith. He fires on full-auto again and puts a die into each zombie. He misses </p>
<p>Zombie D but hits with a raise on Zombie G—it goes down with a damage total of 13 (a raise over </p>
<p>its Toughness).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the shot at Zombie F comes up a 2. The Innocent Bystander rules kick in (page </p>
<p>73) and Private Dan is hit for 2d8 damage! The Lt. grimaces, rolls, and causes 12 damage. Dan is </p>
<p>already at 3 wounds and this causes more, so he’s Incapacitated. He makes a Vigor roll at –3 for </p>
<p>his wounds and gets a total of 2. He rolls on the Injury Table and is Bleeding Out (page 69). He’ll </p>
<p>have to make Vigor rolls each round to keep from dying unless Lt. Griffith can finish the zombies </p>
<p>and heal him.</p>
<p>But the GM asks Lt. Griffith to make a Fear check as he sees his trooper fall to the gruesome </p>
<p>monsters. He fails.</p>
<p>The last thing Private Dan sees is his commanding officer run screaming into the night.</p>

<p>The following chapter contains rules you need </p>
<p>only  in  particular  situations—such  as  handling </p>
<p>large  groups  of  allies,  chases,  or  dealing  with </p>
<p>hazards such as fire, drowning, or radiation.</p>
<p>If this is your first time through the book, skim </p>
<p>over the various sections so you know what’s in </p>
<p>here, then come back and check them out in detail </p>
<p>when you need them.</p>
<p><b>Allies:</b>  Whether  they’re  sturdy  men-at-arms,  a </p>
<p>hardy pirate crew, or soldiers under the heroes’ </p>
<p>command, Allies are often a big part of <i>Savage </i></p>
<p><i>Worlds. </i> Here  you’ll  find  statistics  for  common </p>
<p>henchmen, how to use them, and how to increase </p>
<p>the experience of those who survive your warriors’ </p>
<p>adventures.</p>
<p><b>Chases:</b> Fast-paced chases between hunter and </p>
<p>prey are the subject of this section. Run anything </p>
<p>from  cat-and-mouse  car  chases  through  busy </p>
<p>cities to massive dogfights with this simple system. </p>
<p>For those who played previous versions of <i>Savage </i></p>
<p><i>Worlds,</i> this is all new and greatly simplified.</p>
<p><b>Dramatic Tasks:</b> Defusing a bomb, performing </p>
<p>an ancient ritual, or hacking a computer are all </p>
<p>Dramatic Tasks. These  rules  turn  what  would </p>
<p>otherwise be simple skill rolls into a tense and </p>
<p>exciting encounter.</p>
<p><b>Fear:</b> This is the section to turn to when your hero </p>
<p>faces Things Man Was Not Meant to Know. Fear </p>
<p>tests and the grim consequences of failing them </p>
<p>are found within.</p>
<p><b>Hazards:</b> Hazards include the rules for Fatigue, </p>
<p>plus Bumps and Bruises, Cold, Disease, Drowning, </p>
<p>Falling,  Fire,  Heat,  Hunger,  Poison,  Radiation, </p>
<p>Sleep, and Thirst.</p>
<p><b>Interludes:</b> Books, movies, and real life provide </p>
<p>heroes  with  many  opportunities  to  share </p>
<p>something of their personality or their past with </p>
<p>their companions. This often gets overlooked in </p>
<p>roleplaying games where the narrative is focused </p>
<p>on action and mysteries. Interludes address this </p>
<p>by giving some form and function to small talk, and </p>
<p>rewarding those players who get into character </p>
<p>and roleplay a dramatic tale of their adventurer’s </p>
<p>backstory.</p>
<p><b>Mass  Battles:</b>  Many  Savage  Settings  feature </p>
<p>massive  wars,  bloody  battles,  and  terrible </p>
<p>conflicts. This system gives the Game Master and </p>
<p>the player characters a way to game out any size </p>
<p>battle quickly and dramatically. It also provides </p>
<p>a way for the heroes to get in on the action and </p>
<p>influence the final results.</p>
<p><b>Setting  Rules:</b>  The  standard  rules  are  a </p>
<p>foundation for your campaign. Setting Rules help </p>
<p>one world stand out from another. Here you’ll find </p>
<p>rules like Blood &amp; Guts—which allows players to </p>
<p>spend  Bennies on  damage  rolls!  Or  No  Power </p>
<p>Points, which trades the Power Point system for </p>
<p>a faster but riskier method. These Setting Rules </p>
<p>are referenced in the One Sheet adventures at the </p>
<p>end of this book at the start of each tale.</p>
<p><b>Social  Conflicts:</b>  How  do  you  handle  a  court </p>
<p>case? What do you do if your heroes petition the </p>
<p>king for aid—while a rival actively works against </p>
<p>them? This section presents a simple and dramatic </p>
<p>system for social conflicts based on Persuasion </p>
<p>and  how  successful—or  unsuccessful—the </p>
<p>petitioner is.</p>
<p><b>Travel:</b> Here you’ll find guidelines for travel times </p>
<p>and how to stage encounters along the way.</p>
<p><b>Vehicles:</b> Vehicular battles are a staple of post-</p>
<p>apocalyptic fiction, World War II adventures, and </p>
<p>other technological settings. This section covers </p>
<p>how to  move vehicles  on the  table-top,  handle </p>
<p>attacks between them, and what happens when </p>
<p>they go out of control.</p>

<p>Allies</p>
<p>Allies play a big part in many <i>Savage Worlds</i> </p>
<p>games. They serve as troops under your hero’s </p>
<p>command in <i>Weird War</i> games, loyal retainers </p>
<p>in fantasy settings, or fellow fighters in glorious </p>
<p>rebellions against oppression.</p>
<p>Keeping  up  with  allies  in <i> Savage  Worlds</i>  is </p>
<p>simple.  Just  download  the Ally  Sheet  from  our </p>
<p>website and fill in the blanks. </p>
<p>Allied.Personalities</p>
<p>You can add a little flavor to your allies by rolling </p>
<p>on the Personality Table. Jot down the keyword on </p>
<p>the Ally Sheet so that you and your Game Master </p>
<p>can have a little insight into each particular ally’s </p>
<p>character.</p>
<p>For the most part, you should consider these </p>
<p>general  impressions  with  no  particular  game </p>
<p>effect. What they can do is help both the players </p>
<p>and the GM decide just how an ally might react </p>
<p>in a given situation. In a <i>Weird War Two</i> game, </p>
<p>for  instance,  a  player  with  a  young  lieutenant </p>
<p>character could look over his list and choose the </p>
<p>“Observant”  character  to  pull  guard  duty.  If  he </p>
<p>has to go with the “Lazy” soldier for some reason, </p>
<p>there’s a good chance the GM will rule he falls </p>
<p>asleep sometime during his watch. </p>

<p>Allies.&amp;.Experience</p>
<p>Allies  who  take  part  in  battle  with  their  more </p>
<p>heroic employers gain experience as well—but not </p>
<p>as quickly as player characters. Don’t keep track </p>
<p>of their experience points—just roll randomly to </p>
<p>see if they’ve “leveled.”</p>
<p>At the end of a game session in which the allies </p>
<p>had  a  significant  role  (usually  by  participating </p>
<p>in combat), roll a d6 for each group of identical </p>
<p>troops. On a roll of 5-6, the survivors level up just </p>
<p>like player characters and get one Advance. On </p>
<p>a failure, they don’t.</p>
<p>Ammo</p>
<p>Keeping  track  of  ammo  for  all  your  firearm-</p>
<p>bearing allies can be a real pain. Here’s an easy </p>
<p>and dramatic way to handle this problem.</p>
<p>The ammo level of each group of allied Extras </p>
<p>starts at Very High, High (the usual level), Low, </p>
<p>or Out, as determined by the GM. A dot for each </p>
<p>of these ammunition states can be found on the </p>
<p>Ally Sheet.</p>
<p>After each fight, the ammo drops a level (unless </p>
<p>the GM feels the allies didn’t really use much in </p>
<p>that scene). In combat, if the allies are dealt a </p>
<p>Two,  their  ammo  level  drops  a  level <i> after</i>  that </p>
<p>round. This  makes  for  dramatic  situations  and </p>
<p>realistic  logistical  problems  while  eliminating  a </p>
<p>major bookkeeping chore.</p>
<p>Typical.Allies</p>
<p>Here are a few typical soldier archetypes you </p>
<p>might use for your own <i>Savage Worlds</i> games. </p>
<p>Fill in any additional skills or Edges as you see </p>
<p>fit. A group of rangers, for example, should have </p>
<p>the Tracking skill, while cavalrymen should have </p>
<p>the Riding skill, and so on.</p>

<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p>Chases</p>
<p>The  Vehicle  Rules  on  page  113  handle  fast-</p>
<p>paced action on the table-top. This is impractical </p>
<p>for chases that take place over longer distances </p>
<p>such as city streets or the open ocean, so use the </p>
<p>Chase rules instead. It’s built for situations when </p>
<p>the heroes must catch someone or something—or </p>
<p>escape from it!</p>
<p>Chase.Length</p>
<p>First determine the length of the Chase:</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Standard:</b> Five rounds, used for most chases </p>
<p>and usually simulates less than a minute of </p>
<p>action per turn.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Extended:</b> 10 rounds, used for long pursuits </p>
<p>such as those that take place between ships, </p>
<p>and may be measured in minutes, hours, or </p>
<p>even days.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Dogfight:</b>  The  “chase”  is  actually  a  battle </p>
<p>with  highly  mobile  participants.  It  ends  only </p>
<p>when  one  side  or  the  other  withdraws  or </p>
<p>accomplishes its objectives.</p>
<p>At  the  end  of  the  last  round,  any  prey  who </p>
<p>haven’t  been  otherwise  stopped  or  captured </p>
<p>escape and the pursuit ends.</p>
<p>Chase.Cards</p>
<p>Rather than dealing Action Card as usual, have </p>
<p>everyone roll the appropriate “maneuvering Trait” </p>
<p>as listed below:</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Agility:</b> Foot chase</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Boating:</b> Watercraft</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Driving:</b> Vehicular chase</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Piloting:</b> Air or spacecraft</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Riding:</b> Mounted animals</p>
<p>Participants draw a card for each success and </p>
<p>raise on the maneuvering Trait roll, and keep one </p>
<p>(usually the highest) as their Action Card. This </p>
<p>determines not only their initiative but how well </p>
<p>they managed to “maneuver” that particular round.</p>
<p>Characters  who  don’t  score  at  least  a  single </p>
<p>success remain in the chase but get no Action </p>
<p>Card that round.</p>
<p>Making a maneuvering Trait roll does not count </p>
<p>as an action.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Advantage: </b> A  character  with  a  higher  card </p>
<p>than a foe is said to have “advantage” over him. </p>
<p>This  is  abstract  so  it  may  mean  the  character </p>
<p>is  ahead,  behind,  or  even  parallel  to  his  foe. </p>
<p>The  important  thing  is  that  he  has  somehow </p>
<p>maneuvered in such a way as to gain a superior </p>
<p>position, and can bring his weapons to bear (if he </p>
<p>has any and is inclined to use them). See <b>Attacks</b> </p>

<p>►</p>
<p><b>Speed:</b> A character may add +2 to his roll if </p>
<p>he or his vehicle has a higher top speed than the </p>
<p>fastest opponent; or +4 if his top speed is twice </p>
<p>as  fast  as  his  opponent’s.  (Use  Pace  plus  the </p>
<p>character’s  maximum  possible  running  value  if </p>
<p>on foot or mounted.)</p>

<p><b>Edges:</b>  Level  Headed  and  the  Quick  Edge </p>
<p>don’t apply to maneuvering Trait rolls in Chases.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Terrain:</b> If the Chase takes place primarily over </p>
<p>difficult terrain, the GM should inflict a –2 penalty </p>
<p>to all participants’ Trait rolls.</p>

<p><b>Climb:</b> If an aircraft has a better Climb than </p>
<p>his foe, he may also add +2 to the roll.</p>

<p><b>Passengers:</b> Those riding in a vehicle have </p>
<p>a choice. If they want to help the pilot or driver </p>

<p>of  the  situation,  they  may  make  a  cooperative </p>

<p>themselves but may add to the driver’s total as </p>
<p>usual.</p>
<p>The GM must decide what makes sense here. </p>
<p>A  passenger  in  a  car  might  help  navigate  and </p>
<p>make a cooperative roll—but a second passenger </p>
<p>probably could not. On a sailing ship, the crew </p>
<p>could make a group cooperative Boating roll to </p>
<p>help the captain’s total.</p>
<p>A passenger who makes a cooperative roll and </p>
<p>wants to act would suffer the usual multi-action </p>
<p>penalty.  Passengers  act  on  the  driver’s Action </p>
<p>Card.</p>
<p>Attacks</p>
<p>Characters act on their Action Card as usual. </p>
<p>Since distance is abstract, the value of their Action </p>
<p>Card  determines  any  penalties  to  the  roll  due </p>
<p>to Range and whether or not a melee attack is </p>
<p>possible (in chases where it’s even a possibility).</p>
<p>A character must have Advantage (an equal or </p>
<p>higher Action Card) than his target to attack it. A </p>
<p>character with an Action Card of 7, for example, can </p>
<p>only attack targets with Action Cards of 7 or lower. </p>
<p>A target with a higher card has outmaneuvered the </p>
<p>attacker this round and cannot be targeted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Groups:</b>  Extras  roll  as  distinct  groups  and </p>
<p>act  on  the  same Action  Card  as  usual.  Divide </p>
<p>each group’s attacks up proportionately among </p>
<p>the  opposition,  losing  attacks  against  heroes </p>
<p>who  have Advantage  over  them.  For  example, </p>
<p>nine  wolves  act  on  Seven  and  there  are  five </p>
<p>player characters, so each hero is assigned two </p>
<p>wolves. Any heroes who have higher cards than </p>
<p>the wolves aren’t attacked that round. (This keeps </p>
<p>characters with low cards from getting attacked </p>
<p>by every enemy in the chase.)</p>
<p>The opposite is not true. The player characters </p>
<p>may always attack any foe or group of foes they </p>
<p>have Advantage over.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Force:</b> A driver with advantage may attempt to </p>
<p>distract or even ram another vehicle in the chase </p>
<p>as a normal action. The “trappings” may vary, but </p>
<p>it is treated as an opposed maneuvering Trait roll </p>
<p>modified  by  range.  (Cooperative  rolls  may  be </p>
<p>allowed as usual.) On a success, the target suffers </p>
<p>a –2 to his next maneuvering Trait roll. On a raise, </p>
<p>the target is affected as if they hit an obstacle (see </p>
<p>Complications).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Shaken Characters: </b>If a character driving or </p>
<p>piloting a vehicle is Shaken, he must make an </p>
<p>Out of Control roll (see page 115). If the vehicle </p>
<p>suffers damage, calculate it at half the vehicle’s </p>
<p>Top Speed (see page 113).</p>
<p>Characters  who  are  Shaken  at  the  start  of  a </p>
<p>turn make their maneuvering Trait roll at –2. They </p>
<p>attempt  to  become  un-Shaken  on  their Action </p>
<p>Card as usual.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--96</p>
<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p>Complications</p>
<p>If a character’s Action Card is a Club, he faces </p>
<p>some sort of Compli cation on his action. Check </p>
<p>the Complications Table.</p>
<p>Players who rolled high enough to get multiple </p>
<p>cards may choose to take a lower card to avoid </p>
<p>a  Complication. After  the  Complication  is  dealt </p>
<p>with,  the  character  may  continue  his  action  as </p>
<p>usual—assuming he survived.</p>
<p>Example:.Knights.&amp;.Bandits</p>
<p>The heroes are a knight and a squire chasing </p>
<p>three bandits through the woods. The knights are </p>
<p>on horseback while the bandits are on foot.</p>
<p>The three bandits make a group Agility roll (as </p>
<p>they’re on foot) and get a 5. That’s one success </p>
<p>so they draw a single card—a lowly Three.</p>
<p>The squire’s Riding roll is 7 after adding +2 for </p>
<p>being faster than the bandits. That’s one success </p>
<p>so he draws one Action Card—a Jack of Clubs. </p>
<p>Clubs  signals  a  Complication,  and  the  Jack </p>
<p>indicates a Minor Obstacle (the GM decides he </p>
<p>must avoid low-hanging branches). The Squire </p>
<p>fails and is hit by the heavy limbs for Fatigue from </p>
<p>Bumps and Bruises.</p>
<p>The knight’s Riding total is 13. He draws three </p>
<p>cards and chooses the best—a Joker. Since he’s </p>
<p>ahead of the bandits and has a King or higher he </p>
<p>can make a melee attack. He levels his lance and </p>
<p>one less rogue plagues the King’s Road.</p>
<p>Example:.Road.Warriors</p>
<p>Abel drives a rig through the wasteland. Big Ben </p>
<p>rides shotgun beside him, while Cale mans the </p>
<p>turret on the back of the fuel tanker. Dala trails </p>
<p>behind on a motorcycle.</p>
<p>Chasing them are five gangers on motorbikes. </p>
<p>They make a group Driving roll of 7, draw a single </p>
<p>card, and get an Eight.</p>
<p>Abel makes a Driving roll and gets a 7. Big Ben </p>
<p>decides to “navigate,” pointing out the debris in </p>
<p>the road ahead, and makes a cooperative Driving </p>
<p>roll. He’s successful and adds +2 to Abel’s total, </p>
<p>making it 9. That’s a success and a raise, so Abel </p>
<p>draws two cards and takes the highest—a Ten. </p>
<p>He’s faster than the gangers, so they can’t attack </p>
<p>him this round.</p>
<p>Cale mans a crossbow turret on the back of the </p>
<p>rig. He acts on Abel’s card of Ten, meaning he’s at </p>
<p>Long Range (–4). He fires and a scores a kill—a </p>
<p>ganger bites the radioactive dust.</p>
<p>Dala  is  on  a  motorcycle  and  rolls  a  4.  She </p>
<p>gets one card—a Four of Clubs. That’s a Major </p>
<p>Obstacle  Complication  so  she  has  to  make  a </p>
<p>Driving roll at –2 or suffer a nasty wipeout. She </p>
<p>barely makes it, the GM describing her skidding </p>
<p>around an outcropping of rocks.</p>
<p>The  gangers  are  on  Eight  so  they  can  only </p>
<p>attack  Dala  (on  a  Four).  Since  there  are  five </p>
<p>of them and four targets, the GM divides them </p>
<p>up proportionately and decides only two are in </p>
<p>position  to  attack.  One  ganger  misses  but  the </p>
<p>other  scores  a  hit  and  wounds  Dala,  meaning </p>
<p>she has to make another Driving roll or go Out </p>
<p>of Control.</p>
<p>Dramatic.Tasks</p>
<p>Heroes  often  find  themselves  in  dramatic </p>
<p>situations such as defusing a bomb or hacking a </p>
<p>computer with a definite—and often deadly—time </p>
<p>limit. The system below simulates these events </p>
<p>and helps the Game Master throw some monkey </p>
<p>wrenches and drama into what would otherwise </p>
<p>be simple skill rolls.</p>
<p>To  start,  first  determine  the  skill  to  be  used, </p>
<p>such  as  Knowledge  (Demolitions)  to  defuse  a </p>
<p>bomb, Knowledge (Occult) to complete a ritual, </p>
<p>Knowledge  (Electronics)  to  hack  a  computer, </p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>A standard Dramatic Task takes five “actions,” </p>
<p>and requires the same number of successes (see </p>
<p>below). Actions here may mean combat rounds </p>
<p>or they may mean “attempts.” That’s entirely up </p>
<p>to the Game Master and the situation.</p>
<p>Performing.a.Dramatic.Task</p>
<p>Each  action,  the  hero  draws  an Action  Card </p>
<p>(even  if  not  in  combat)  and  acts  on  that  card. </p>
<p>Edges such as Level Headed or Quick work as </p>
<p>usual.</p>
<p>If  the  character  nets  five  successes  with </p>
<p>the  required  Trait  before  time  runs  out,  he’s </p>
<p>accomplished his goal. It’s best to keep track of </p>
<p>these successes with tokens of some sort so you </p>
<p>don’t forget from round to round—and to give the </p>
<p>player a visible measure of his success.</p>
<p>If time runs out and the hero has not acquired </p>
<p>five  successes,  the  bomb  detonates,  the  ritual </p>
<p>fails, the computer shuts down, an alarm sounds, </p>
<p>or the action otherwise fails. It’s up to the Game </p>
<p>Master whether it may be attempted again, but </p>
<p>since this was a Dramatic Task, it should normally </p>
<p>have resulted in something very bad, or at least </p>
<p>require an entirely new approach to attempt again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Difficulty:</b> Most Dramatic Tasks should have </p>
<p>at least a –2 modifier. This reflects any safeguards </p>
<p>on a bomb, the complexity of a ritual, security on </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--97</p>
<p>Situational.Rules</p>
<p>a computer, etc. These are <i>dramatic </i>tasks, and by </p>
<p>their very nature should be fairly difficult.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Cooperative  Rolls:</b>  Other  characters  may </p>
<p>assist  the  acting  hero  as  usual,  using  the </p>
<p>Cooperative Rolls rule on page 71.</p>
<p>Complications</p>
<p>If the acting character’s Action Card is a Club, </p>
<p>something  has  gone  horribly  wrong.  He  must </p>
<p>make his roll this turn at –2 (in addition to any </p>
<p>other  modifiers).  If  failed,  the  worst  possible </p>
<p>resolution to the task occurs—the target escapes, </p>
<p>the argument ends violently, the bomb explodes, </p>
<p>or the battle is lost.</p>
<p><i><b>Example: </b>Ian “Haxxor” McTavish is trying </i></p>
<p><i>to  hack  into  a  high-security  mainframe  at </i></p>
<p><i>the corporate headquarters of Genesis, Inc. </i></p>
<p><i>He draws a Three of Clubs and must make </i></p>
<p><i>his  Knowledge  (Computers)  roll this round </i></p>
<p><i>at  –2.  If  he  fails,  Genesis  security  system </i></p>
<p><i>detects the intrusion. In this high-tech world </i></p>
<p><i>of netrunners, the Game Master decides Ian </i></p>
<p><i>doesn’t just fail—a powerful jolt of electricity </i></p>
<p><i>is sent through the cables for 2d6 damage!</i></p>
<p>Example:.Defusing.a.Bomb</p>
<p>The  heroes  are  counter-terrorist  operatives </p>
<p>holding off waves of suicidal attackers while their </p>
<p>demolitions  expert,  John,  attempts  to  defuse  a </p>
<p>nuclear weapon. The Game Master decides the </p>
<p>skill required is Knowledge (Demolitions), and all </p>
<p>rolls suffer a –2 penalty due to the bomb’s inherent </p>
<p>complexity.</p>
<p>On  the  first  round,  the  rest  of  the  heroes </p>
<p>attack  the  terrorists  while  John  tries  to  defuse </p>
<p>the bomb. His Action Card is a Six of Clubs—a </p>
<p>Complication! The Game Master tells John the </p>
<p>bomb was booby-trapped. John puts everything </p>
<p>he has into the roll this turn and asks for help from </p>
<p>one of his teammates who also has Knowledge </p>
<p>(Demolitions).</p>
<p>The companion makes a cooperative roll and </p>
<p>adds  +2  to  John’s  total.  John  starts  by  rolling </p>
<p>a pathetic 3. He spends a Benny and rolls a 7. </p>
<p>The –2 for the task makes it 5 and the –2 for the </p>
<p>Complication  makes  it  a  3.  The  companion’s </p>
<p>cooperative roll brings it back up to 5—and saves </p>
<p>the day!</p>
<p>John  now  needs  four  more  successes  to </p>
<p>defuse the bomb. This round he draws a Joker—</p>
<p>breakthrough! “I’ve figured out the bomb-maker’s </p>
<p>pattern,” he says confidently and gets a raise on </p>
<p>his  Knowledge  (Demolitions)  roll.  Now  he  has </p>
<p>three total successes.</p>
<p>In the third round, John gets a Nine but fails his </p>
<p>roll. He starts to sweat.</p>
<p>Round four. John manages one success for a </p>
<p>running total of four. “I don’t know if I’m going to </p>
<p>make it!” he yells to the team. Soon after, John </p>
<p>takes a wound from one of the terrorists’ rifles, </p>
<p>leaving him Shaken and wounded!</p>
<p>It’s  the  fifth  round. The  terrorists  are  closing </p>
<p>in. John gets an Ace for his Action Card but fails </p>
<p>his Spirit roll to recover from being Shaken! He </p>
<p>spends his last Benny to eliminate the Shaken </p>
<p>result,  calls  for  help  from  his  friend  again,  and </p>
<p>makes  his  Knowledge  (Demolitions)  roll.  If  he </p>
<p>makes it, the nuke is defused. If he doesn’t—it’s </p>
<p>time to start a new campaign!</p>
<p>Example:.The.Ritual</p>
<p>The heroes are five investigators trying to stop </p>
<p>an ancient and terrifying creature from entering </p>
<p>our  world.  Four  of  the  team  battle  the  cultists </p>
<p>who summoned it in their underground lair. The </p>
<p>fifth, Professor Carter, begins to read a magical </p>
<p>incantation  he  believes  will  close  the  gate  and </p>
<p>send the thing back to whatever hell it came from.</p>
<p>In the first two rounds, the confident Dr. Carter </p>
<p>gets four total successes. In the third, things go </p>
<p>awry. He draws the unfortunate Seven of Clubs. </p>
<p>The  Game  Master  describes  a  sudden  surge </p>
<p>of  tentacles  and  amorphous  yet  angular  ooze </p>
<p>seeping into our world.</p>
<p>Professor Carter rolls at –2 and fails. “All hail </p>
<p>our new masters,” says the doctor just before the </p>
<p>Thing from another world devours him and begins </p>
<p>a reign of terror that lasts a thousand years.</p>
<p>Not every story has a happy ending. These are </p>
<p><i>savage</i> worlds, after all…</p>
<p>Fear</p>
<p>Certain  creatures  and  horrific  scenes  may </p>
<p>challenge a character’s resolve and cause them </p>
<p>to make a Fear check (a Spirit roll) when they </p>
<p>see them. A success on the Spirit roll means the </p>
<p>character manages to overcome the situation and </p>
<p>carry on. A failed Fear roll depends on whether </p>
<p>the cause of the roll was grotesque or terrifying </p>
<p>in nature.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Fear/Nausea:</b> If the scene was grotesque or </p>
<p>horrific, such as a grisly discovery or learning </p>
<p>a secret “Man Was Not Meant to Know,” the </p>
<p>character is Shaken and must make a Vigor </p>
<p>roll or suffer severe nausea/mental shock that </p>
<p>causes a level of Fatigue for the remainder </p>
<p>of the encounter. A natural 1 on the Spirit die </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--98</p>
<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p>(regardless of the Wild Die) causes the victim </p>
<p>to roll on the Fright Table as well.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Terror:</b> A terrifying trigger, such as a monstrous </p>
<p>creature  or  unknowable  evil,  is  much  more </p>
<p>intense, and can rattle even the most stout-</p>
<p>hearted hero. Extras are typically Panicked. </p>
<p>Wild Cards must roll on the Fright Table should </p>
<p>they fail their Fear check. Roll 1d20 and add </p>
<p>the monster’s Fear penalty, if any, to the roll (a </p>
<p>–2 adds +2 to the roll, for example).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Becoming  Jaded:</b> After  encountering  a </p>
<p>particular type of creature, the character shouldn’t </p>
<p>have to make Fear checks every time he sees </p>
<p>another one in that particular scenario. If the party </p>
<p>clears out a dungeon full of zombies, for example, </p>
<p>they should only have to roll the first time they </p>
<p>encounter them—not in every room. The Game </p>
<p>Master might require a roll if the heroes encounter </p>
<p>zombies in a particularly different or frightening </p>
<p>situation, however, such as if they fall into a pit </p>
<p>full of the ravenous creatures.</p>

<p>Situational.Rules</p>
<p>Hazards</p>
<p>Heat,  cold,  hunger,  thirst,  lack  of  sleep,  and </p>
<p>other hazards can wear down even the hardiest </p>
<p>heroes,  sending  them  into  a  downward  spiral </p>
<p>that  can  lead  to  death  if  he  can’t  improve  his </p>
<p>situation.  Drowning,  fire,  and  falling  are  much </p>
<p>more immediate dangers, while others are more </p>
<p>insidious—such as poison and disease.</p>
<p>On the following pages are the most common </p>
<p>hazards, with details on when a character must </p>
<p>roll,  any  important  modifiers,  and  how  one </p>
<p>recovers from any effects he’s suffered from it. </p>
<p>Use these hazards mostly for dramatic purposes. </p>
<p>A quick trip to the outhouse through a blizzard isn’t </p>
<p>worth keeping up with, but a long trek through </p>
<p>the Mountains of Dread certainly is, especially if </p>
<p>it heightens the drama and makes the party think </p>
<p>about things they might otherwise ignore, such </p>
<p>as shelter, warm clothing, or eating their mounts </p>
<p>to stay alive.</p>
<p>Fatigue</p>
<p>Some hazards cause direct damage, but most </p>
<p>cause Fatigue—stress or weakness that makes </p>
<p>a victim less effective and can eventually lead to </p>
<p>Incapacitation or even death.</p>
<p>A character who falls victim to Fatigue passes </p>
<p>through  several  declining  states  before  finally </p>
<p>succumbing to his stress. Each of these states </p>
<p>and the penalties they incur are described below.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Fatigued: </b>The hero is tiring quickly. All of his </p>
<p>Trait checks suffer a –1 modifier. If he suffers </p>
<p>Fatigue again, he becomes Exhausted.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Exhausted:</b>  The  hero  is  fading  fast.  He </p>
<p>suffers –2 to all Trait rolls. If he suffers Fatigue </p>
<p>again, he’s Incapacitated unless the hazard </p>
<p>description says otherwise.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Incapacitated:</b> The  victim  collapses  and  is </p>
<p>Incapacitated.  See  Incapacitation  Effects </p>
<p>under each Hazard for what happens next. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Recovery:</b>  Recovering  from  Fatigue  varies </p>
<p>depending on its source. Severe hunger requires </p>
<p>food, cold requires warmth, and so on. Exactly </p>
<p>how Fatigue is relieved depends on how it was </p>
<p>acquired. This is explained under each Hazard.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Multiple  Hazards:</b>  It  doesn’t  matter  what </p>
<p>the source of Fatigue is. If a hero who’s already </p>
<p>Exhausted  from  hunger  then  suffers  a  level  of </p>
<p>Fatigue  from  cold,  he  becomes  Incapacitated. </p>
<p>A  character  suffering  from  multiple  sources  of </p>
<p>Fatigue must address <i>both</i> to recover.</p>
<p>Bumps.and.Bruises</p>
<p>Characters  who  suffer  minor  but  troubling </p>
<p>injuries,  such  as  stumbling  down  a  slope  or </p>
<p>running through a cavern in the dark, can suffer </p>
<p>from Fatigue rather than suffering actual wounds. </p>
<p>This is the hazard to use when characters should </p>
<p>be beat up a bit but not truly wounded.</p>
<p>When  a  character  suffers  injuries  like  these </p>
<p>he must make a Vigor roll. Those who fail gain </p>
<p>a Fatigue level from bumps, bruises, cuts, and </p>
<p>scrapes. The  Game  Master  may  occasionally </p>
<p>allow sure-footed characters to make Agility rolls </p>
<p>to avoid this damage instead. Fatigue gained in </p>
<p>this way can lead to Exhaustion, but not to being </p>
<p>Incapacitated.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Recovery: </b> Fatigue  levels  from  Bumps  and </p>
<p>Bruises  automatically  improve  one  step  24 </p>
<p>hours after the original injuries were suffered.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Incapacitation Effects:</b> None. A victim cannot </p>
<p>be Incapacitated from Bumps and Bruises.</p>
<p><i><b>Example:</b> Two heroes race down a steep </i></p>
<p><i>slope to escape the clutches of some angry </i></p>
<p><i>crocodile cultists. The Game Master decides </i></p>
<p><i>they trip and suffer Bumps and Bruises if they </i></p>
<p><i>don’t make Agility rolls. The first succeeds but </i></p>
<p><i>the second fails and suffers Fatigue for the </i></p>
<p><i>next 24 hours.</i></p>
<p>Cold</p>
<p>Trudging through deep snow for hours on end, </p>
<p>or facing biting, bitter winds, can dehydrate and </p>
<p>fatigue a character as quickly as blazing deserts. </p>
<p>Every four hours spent in weather below freezing </p>
<p>(32° F), a character must make a Vigor roll. Failure </p>
<p>means the victim gains a Fatigue level. Subtract </p>
<p>1 from the victim’s Vigor roll for every 20 degrees </p>
<p>below freezing to a maximum of –3.</p>
<p>The roll assumes the character is wearing warm </p>
<p>clothing. If not, subtract 2 from the total. Modern </p>
<p>winter gear adds +2, and advanced gear (arctic </p>
<p>suits) add at least +4 or more depending on the </p>
<p>setting.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Recovery:</b>  Warmth  and  shelter  from  the </p>
<p>elements allows a hero to recover a Fatigue </p>
<p>level every 30 minutes.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Incapacitation  Effects:</b>  Make  a  Vigor  roll </p>
<p>every hour or perish.</p>
<p>Disease</p>
<p>Diseases cover a wide range of maladies, from </p>
<p>long-term  debilitating  illnesses  to  those  which </p>
<p>might  cause  immediate  spasms  or  death.  To </p>
<p>handle such a diverse range of diseases, we’ve </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--100</p>
<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p>broken them down into those most likely to come </p>
<p>into play in a typical game or campaign session. </p>
<p>If you’re trying to model a specific disease, you’ll </p>
<p>want to adjust the rules to better reflect that illness’ </p>
<p>symptoms.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Recovery:</b>  Unless  the  disease  description </p>
<p>says  otherwise,  it  can  only  be  treated  with </p>
<p>specific medicines or very powerful magic. If </p>
<p>the proper medicine is available, all the victim’s </p>
<p>ailments  vanish  in  2d6  days  minus  half  his </p>
<p>Vigor die type, to a minimum of one day. If not, </p>
<p>healers can make the victim more comfortable </p>
<p>but have no further effect on his condition. For </p>
<p>magical healing, see page 133.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Incapacitation Effects:</b> Typically death unless </p>
<p>the text details a different result.</p>
<p>Contracting.Diseases</p>
<p>Diseases  may  be  acquired  in  one  of  the </p>
<p>following ways:</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Airborne:</b> The toxin is in the air. If a character </p>
<p>is aware of the toxin he can hold his breath for </p>
<p>a number of rounds equal to 2 plus his Vigor </p>
<p>die, or half that if he wasn’t prepared. After that </p>
<p>he must breathe and automatically contracts </p>
<p>the disease. If the victim is surprised by the </p>
<p>release of the disease (such as a creature with </p>
<p>exploding spores), he must make a Smarts </p>
<p>roll to hold his breath before the tainted air </p>
<p>enters his lungs.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Touch:</b> The  victim  must  make  a  Vigor  roll </p>
<p>immediately on being touched. If successful, </p>
<p>the disease didn’t manage to “take” and there </p>
<p>is no effect. Failure means the disease takes </p>
<p>immediate effect as described below.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Induction:</b>  The  disease  must  enter  the </p>
<p>bloodstream,  most  typically  by  an  animal’s </p>
<p>bite, or a cut by an infected weapon. In these </p>
<p>cases, if a victim is Shaken or wounded by </p>
<p>such an attack, he must make a Vigor roll. If </p>
<p>failed, he contracts the disease. If successful, </p>
<p>the  disease  didn’t  manage  to  get  into  the </p>
<p>bloodstream and there is no further effect.</p>
<p>Disease.Types</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Long-Term  Chronic,  Majorly  Debilitating:</b> </p>
<p>These  diseases  cause  constant  irritation </p>
<p>and exhaustion and eventually end in death. </p>
<p>Leprosy,  untreated  tuberculosis,  and  similar </p>
<p>fatal diseases fall into this category. Victims </p>
<p>have frequent spasms and coughing fits and </p>
<p>so  are  always  Exhausted.  If  they  suffer  an </p>
<p>additional Fatigue level, they are Incapacitated </p>
<p>but  do  not  die. At  the  start  of  every  game </p>
<p>session,  the  character  must  make  a  Vigor </p>
<p>roll. If his total is ever a 1 or less, he’s going </p>
<p>to pass away before the end of that session. </p>
<p>The  Game  Master  is  encouraged  to  let  the </p>
<p>hero go out with style if possible, but he will </p>
<p>perish before the game ends this time.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Long-Term  Chronic,  Minorly  Debilitating:</b> </p>
<p>This  works  exactly  as  above  except  the </p>
<p>unfortunate hero is constantly Fatigued rather </p>
<p>than  Exhausted.  Examples  of  this  kind  of </p>
<p>disease  include  malaria,  fantasy  diseases </p>
<p>such as the touch of certain undead, or living </p>
<p>in a foreign and slightly toxic environment.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Short Term, Debilitating:</b> These are extremely </p>
<p>rare in the real world but are very appropriate </p>
<p>for  fantasy  or  science-fiction  settings. They </p>
<p>are  typically  acquired  from  the  scratch  of  a </p>
<p>creature  or  breathing  air  laden  with  toxins </p>
<p>(see Airborne and Induction, above). A victim </p>
<p>who  fails  his  Vigor  roll  and  contracts  the </p>
<p>disease suffers Fatigue and is Shaken as he </p>
<p>begins  to  cough  and  wretch  uncontrollably. </p>
<p>Once he recovers from being Shaken he may </p>
<p>act normally but the Fatigue level (and thus </p>
<p>the disease) remains for 2d6 days while the </p>
<p>sickness works itself out.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Short  Term,  Lethal:</b>  Even  more  rare  are </p>
<p>diseases that can kill in seconds. Treat this </p>
<p>exactly  as  Lethal  Poison  (see  Poison).  If  a </p>
<p>character  survives  but  suffers  Fatigue  from </p>
<p>the poison, it lasts 2d6 hours.</p>
<p>Drowning</p>
<p>Water is deadly to those who aren’t prepared </p>
<p>for it. Here are some standard water hazards and </p>
<p>how often a character must make a Swimming roll, </p>
<p>with each failure adding a Fatigue level. </p>
<p>•  A character with at least a d4 in Swimming does </p>
<p>not have to roll when in calm water.</p>
<p>•  In  rough  water,  all  characters  must  make  a </p>
<p>Swimming roll every minute.</p>
<p>•  In white water, the hero is swept into eddies and </p>
<p>whirlpools (hydraulics) and rolls every round.</p>
<p>•  A hero forced to tread water for long periods </p>
<p>without a flotation device must roll once every </p>
<p>hour.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Modifiers:</b> Subtract –2 from a hero’s Swimming </p>
<p>rolls if he is trying to hold something up, including </p>
<p>another character. Add 2 to the roll if he’s wearing </p>
<p>a life vest.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Recovery:</b>  Once  a  character  is  out  of  the </p>
<p>water,  he  recovers  one  Fatigue  level  every </p>
<p>five minutes.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--101</p>
<p>Situational.Rules</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Incapacitation Effects:</b> Death in a number </p>
<p>of rounds equal to half the victim’s Vigor die. </p>
<p>If someone can get to the victim within five </p>
<p>minutes  of  “death,”  he  can  be  resuscitated </p>
<p>with a Healing roll at –4.</p>
<p>Falling</p>
<p>Falling  damage  is  1d6+1  per  10  feet  fallen </p>
<p>(round up), to a maximum of 10d6+10. If you’re </p>
<p>playing on the table-top, treat every 2” as 10’ for </p>
<p>simplicity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Snow:</b> Particularly soft ground, such as deep </p>
<p>snow, acts as a cushion. Every foot of soft snow </p>
<p>reduces damage by one point.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Water:</b> A fall into water reduces the number </p>
<p>of  dice  rolled  by  half  (rounded  down),  and  an </p>
<p>Agility roll means the character dives and takes no </p>
<p>damage at all, though he is automatically Shaken </p>
<p>if he dives from a height of greater than 50’. A fall </p>
<p>over 15” (30 yards) requires an Agility roll at –2 </p>
<p>to avoid damage.</p>
<p>Fire</p>
<p>Even giants impervious to the puny weapons of </p>
<p>sword-slingers are often afraid of flame and fire. </p>
<p>Roll the damage listed below when a character </p>
<p>is first burned and at the beginning of each round </p>
<p>until he is free of the flame. Only sealed, fireproof </p>
<p>armor  adds  to  a  character’s Toughness  when </p>
<p>resisting the effects of fire.</p>

<p><b>Spreading:</b> Anytime  something  flammable </p>
<p>is hit by fire, roll 1d6. On a 6, the target catches </p>
<p>fire. Very flammable targets, such as a scarecrow, </p>
<p>catch  fire  on  a  4-6.  Volatile  targets,  such  as  a </p>
<p>person soaked in gasoline, catch fire on anything </p>
<p><i>but </i>a 1.</p>
<p>Each round after a victim catches fire (at the </p>
<p>beginning of his action), roll as if checking to see </p>
<p>if the victim catches fire again. If he does, the fire </p>
<p>grows  in  intensity  and  does  the  damage  listed </p>
<p>above each round.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Smoke  Inhalation:</b>  Fires  in  confined  areas </p>
<p>produce deadly smoke. Every round a character </p>
<p>is in such an environment, he must make a Vigor </p>
<p>roll. A wet cloth over the face adds +2 to the roll, </p>
<p>and  a  gas  mask  negates  the  need  for  the  roll </p>
<p>entirely. If the roll is failed, the character gains a </p>
<p>Fatigue level.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--102</p>
<p>Heat</p>
<p>Intense  heat,  typically  that  over  90  degrees </p>
<p>Fahrenheit,  can  cause  heat  exhaustion  and </p>
<p>heat stroke, both of which are very dangerous. </p>
<p>The actual danger is from dehydration, so well-</p>
<p>supplied and conscientious characters can greatly </p>
<p>improve their chances in extreme heat simply by </p>
<p>carrying  a  good  amount  of  water  and  drinking </p>
<p>frequently.</p>
<p>When the temperature reaches 90 degrees or </p>
<p>more, the GM should pay attention to how much </p>
<p>water  characters  are  able  to  drink.  If  they  are </p>
<p>able to drink at least four quarts of water a day, </p>
<p>they may be tired and sunburned, but are in no </p>
<p>immediate danger.</p>
<p>If that amount of water isn’t available, characters </p>
<p>must make Vigor rolls every four hours. Subtract </p>
<p>two from the roll if the hero has half the water he </p>
<p>needs, and subtract 4 if he has less than half. </p>
<p>Failure means the character gains one level of </p>
<p>Fatigue.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Subtract 1 from the roll for each additional </p>
<p>5 degrees above 90 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Add +1 if the hero stops all physical activity.</p>

<p><b>Recovery:</b> A  victim  who  receives  sufficient </p>
<p>water recovers one Fatigue level every hour.</p>

<p>is  failed,  the  victim’s  Smarts  and  Strength </p>
<p>decrease  by  one  step  permanently  (to  a </p>
<p>minimum of d4).</p>
<p>Hunger</p>
<p>Humans  need  approximately  one  pound  of </p>
<p>food  every  24  hours.  If  sufficient  sustenance </p>
<p>isn’t available, a character begins to suffer from </p>
<p>severe hunger.</p>
<p>Starting the first day after the meal was missed, </p>
<p>the character must make a Vigor roll. Subtract 2 </p>
<p>if the hero has less than half the required amount </p>
<p>of  food.  Failure  means  the  character  gains  a </p>
<p>Fatigue level.</p>
<p>After  the  first  day,  the  character  must  roll  for </p>
<p>hunger every 12 hours, and thirst every 6 hours.</p>

<p>Poison</p>
<p>Poisons  can  be  delivered  many  ways.  If </p>
<p>ingested, its effects occur automatically. If a victim </p>
<p>is Shaken or wounded by a bite or weapon coated </p>
<p>in poison, he must make an immediate Vigor roll </p>
<p>against the type of poison listed on the Poison </p>
<p>Effects Table below. If the poison has a modifier </p>
<p>associated with it (such as Venomous [–2]), the </p>
<p>victim’s Vigor roll is modified appropriately.</p>
<p>The Game Master must decide which category </p>
<p>is appropriate  based  on  the poison.  Most real-</p>
<p>world  animals  are  Venomous  with  only  a  few </p>
<p>falling in the Lethal category. Ghouls might have </p>
<p>paralyzing poison in their claws, while spies might </p>
<p>use Knockout poison in drinks or gases.</p>
<p>Characters who suffer Paralysis or a Knockout </p>
<p>are Incapacitated until they recover.</p>

<p>►</p>
<p><b>Treatment: </b> To  treat  a  poisoned  victim,  the </p>
<p>healer can try a Healing roll minus the strength </p>
<p>of  the  poison  itself  (found  in  the  poison’s </p>
<p>description).  If  successful,  the  victim’s  life  is </p>
<p>saved and the poison no longer has any effect—</p>
<p>paralyzed victims can move and those rendered </p>
<p>unconscious wake.</p>
<p>Each character may only attempt one Healing </p>
<p>roll per incident to cure the poison, but another </p>

<p>attempt, and so on. </p>

<p>and every minute in high radiation. Each failure </p>
<p>results in a Fatigue level.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Recovery:</b> Fatigue from radiation fades at the </p>

<p>Most  people  need  a  minimum  of  six  hours </p>

<p>without this amount of sleep must make a Vigor </p>
<p>roll at a cumulative –2 every 12 hours thereafter </p>

<p>Interludes</p>
<p>In  most  heroic  tales,  characters  engage  in </p>
<p>small  talk  that  reveals  something  about  their </p>
<p>past or further develops their personality. Such </p>
<p>“Interludes”  are  rare  in  roleplaying  games </p>
<p>where we focus primarily on action and the next </p>
<p>encounter.</p>
<p>The system below formulizes these scenes and </p>
<p>rewards players for roleplaying their character and </p>
<p>revealing their backstory to the rest of the group.</p>
<p>Running.an.Interlude.</p>
<p>The Game Master should run an Interlude during </p>
<p>natural down-time such as when healing up after </p>
<p>a fight, performing research, or between legs of </p>
<p>a long trip.</p>
<p>To start, pick a player and have her draw a card. </p>
<p>The Suit determines the general topic as shown on </p>
<p>the Interlude Table below. Each entry requires the </p>
<p>player to tell a story in the voice of her character. </p>
<p>The tale should be substantial enough to take a </p>
<p>few minutes and may draw in other characters’ </p>
<p>participation as well.</p>
<p>The  next  time  the  Game  Master  feels  an </p>
<p>Interlude  is  appropriate,  he  should  pick  a </p>
<p>different player so that everyone has a chance to </p>
<p>participate and reap the rewards.</p>

<p>at it, drop clues, or otherwise give the rest of </p>
<p>the group a glimpse into your hero’s dark side </p>
<p>during your narrative.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Spades—Victory:</b> Tell the group about a great </p>
<p>victory or personal triumph in your adventurer’s </p>
<p>past.  How  did  it  affect  him  afterward?  Was </p>
<p>there a reward?</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Hearts—Love:</b> Speak fondly of the character’s </p>
<p>greatest love—lost, found, or waiting on him </p>
<p>back home. What is her name? Where does </p>
<p>she live? Why is the traveler not with her now?</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Diamonds—Desire:</b>  Tell  a  tale  about </p>
<p>something your hero wants (or already has). </p>
<p>It might be a material possession, recognition, </p>
<p>a political goal, or even a trip he wishes to take </p>
<p>to some amazing destination.</p>
<p>Example:.Crossing.Mars</p>
<p>Colonel Green of the Martian 24th Highlanders, </p>
<p>his  guide  Sanjay  of  the  Gurkhas,  Lady  Emily, </p>
<p>and  big  game  hunter  extraordinaire  Sir  John </p>
<p>Hobbsworth cross the vast Martian desert. They </p>
<p>face sandstorms, intense heat by day, and bone-</p>
<p>numbing cold at night.</p>
<p>The Game Master decides to call for an Interlude </p>
<p>after each encounter along the way.</p>
<p>Colonel Green goes first and draws a Spade. </p>
<p>He describes with great vigor his travails against </p>
<p>the wild Martians at Zimkangaroon and the tense </p>
<p>battle he fought there. “It’s how I got this injury,” </p>
<p>he says as he points to his Lame leg.</p>
<p>Later, after surviving a terrible sandstorm, Lady </p>
<p>Emily draws a Heart. “I will withstand any trauma,” </p>
<p>she begins, “if only it will help me discover what </p>
<p>happened  to  my  beloved  Nathaniel,  lost  in  the </p>
<p>mountains I have asked you all to escort me to.” </p>
<p>She then goes on about how she and Nathaniel </p>
<p>met, traveled to Mars, and began a new life far </p>
<p>away from the grime and corruption of New York </p>
<p>City.</p>
<p>A day later, the party is ambushed by Martian </p>
<p>raiders. Sanjay draws the next card—a Diamond. </p>
<p>“See this bandit blade?” he says proudly. “It is a </p>
<p>poor substitute for my kukri, awarded ten years </p>
<p>ago when I joined the regiment.” Sanjay goes on </p>
<p>to describe his training and some of the terrible </p>
<p>battles he fought in the 6th Gurkha </p>
<p>regiment  before  volunteering  for </p>
<p>service on faraway Mars.</p>
<p>Sir  Hobbsworth  is  next,  with  a </p>
<p>Club.  “I  have  hunted  every </p>
<p>creature on earth. Now I’ve </p>
<p>come  to  Mars  to  bag  the </p>
<p>biggest,  most  ferocious </p>
<p>beast  on  all  the  known </p>
<p>worlds—the crask. I’ll kill </p>
<p>the thing and mount its </p>
<p>head  on  my  wall. And </p>
<p><i>nothing</i> will stop me.” </p>
<p>Hobbsworth  then </p>
<p>hints that he hopes </p>
<p>the  monster  slays </p>
<p>him as he slays it—</p>
<p>revealing  his  Death </p>
<p>Wish  and  the  chronic </p>
<p>disease  he  picked  up </p>
<p>during  the  campaign  in </p>
<p>the process.</p>

<p>Mass.Battles</p>
<p>Truly  savage  worlds  often  feature  wars  with </p>
<p>massive and bloody battles. The system below </p>
<p>rewards players who not only take part in these </p>
<p>battles, but are instrumental in gathering political </p>
<p>support, recruiting troops, and deciding strategies </p>
<p>that win them.</p>
<p>These rules allow the Game Master to handle </p>
<p>everything from a small warband holding a fort </p>
<p>against an undead horde to full divisions of troops </p>
<p>fighting  a  massive  field  battle  or  a  planetary </p>
<p>assault  from  a  space-based  invasion  fleet.  It’s </p>
<p>abstract, but provides a narrative base for heroes </p>
<p>to plan, get involved, and even become involved </p>
<p>in the fight themselves.</p>
<p>Setup</p>
<p>To start, give the larger or more powerful army </p>
<p>10 tokens. Give the opposing army a proportional </p>
<p>number of tokens. If one army has 10,000 men, </p>
<p>for example, and the other has 7,000, give the </p>
<p>smaller army seven tokens.</p>
<p>The Game Master will need to adjust for special </p>
<p>or elite troops, better equipment, and so on. It’s </p>
<p>not important to count every point of armor and </p>
<p>damage  point—just  get  close  enough  to  give </p>
<p>a  reasonable  approximation  of  strength,  adjust </p>
<p>where  needed,  and  trust  in  the  dice  and  the </p>
<p>player’s actions to handle the rest.</p>
<p>Knowledge.(Battle)</p>
<p>Once the odds are determined, both sides make </p>
<p>opposed Knowledge (Battle) rolls, modified by any </p>
<p>of the circumstances below:</p>
<p>Battle.Modifiers</p>
<p><b>Modifier </b></p>
<p><b>Circumstance</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>+1 </p>
<p>The side with more tokens adds +1 for </p>

<p><b>Battle Plan—GM’s Call determined each round</b></p>
<p>  +/–? </p>
<p>The army gains a penalty or a bonus </p>
<p>depending  on  the  tactical  decisions  made  by </p>
<p>the leader each round. Springing a hidden flank </p>
<p>attack, sending reserves to a crucial front, and </p>
<p>so on, all add to the Battle roll.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Casualties:</b> Each success and raise causes </p>
<p>the other side to lose one token. Casualties are </p>
<p>generally distributed evenly throughout the force.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Morale:</b> Each round in which an army loses </p>
<p>a token, its leader must check morale. This is a </p>
<p>Spirit roll modified by the circumstances below. </p>
<p>With  a  success,  the  army  fights  on  and  both </p>
<p>sides  make  another  Knowledge  (Battle)  roll  as </p>
<p>described above.</p>
<p>Failure  means  the  army  is  defeated  but  the </p>
<p>troops conduct an orderly retreat. Make one more </p>
<p>Battle Roll and then end the fight. (A leader may </p>
<p>voluntarily choose this option as well.) </p>
<p>On a result of 1 or less, the troops rout and the </p>
<p>battle is over immediately.</p>

<p><b>Situation</b></p>

<p>The army cannot retreat</p>
<p>Characters.in.Mass.Battles</p>
<p>The heroes of your campaign aren’t likely to sit </p>
<p>idly by while war rages around them. Fighters may </p>
<p>want to charge the gates, wizards unleash fireballs </p>
<p>into the masses, and a gallant knight may ride his </p>
<p>trusty warhorse directly into the enemy formations.</p>
<p>Those who want to get involved can dramatically </p>
<p>affect  the  results  of  the  battle.  Have  each </p>
<p>character make a Fighting, Shooting, or arcane </p>
<p>skill roll (their choice) each action and consult the </p>
<p>Character Results below.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Modifiers: </b> Add  or  subtract  the  number  of </p>
<p>tokens difference between the heroes’ side and </p>
<p>their opponent. If the enemy has 8 tokens and </p>
<p>the heroes have 5, for example, the heroes must </p>
<p>subtract –3 from their attack rolls.</p>
<p>Also add +1 to the roll for each Rank a hero has </p>
<p>above Novice to account for his various Edges and </p>
<p>abilities that aren’t reflected in a straight skill roll.</p>
<p>Character.Battle.Results</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Failure:</b> The hero is stopped by overwhelming </p>
<p>numbers, an unfortunate tactical development, </p>
<p>or bad fortune. He suffers 4d6 damage.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Success:</b> The hero fights well and adds +1 </p>
<p>to  his  side’s  Battle  Roll,  though  he  suffers </p>
<p>3d6 damage.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--107</p>
<p>Situational.Rules</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Raise: </b>The hero wreaks havoc, slaying enemy </p>
<p>leaders and destroying important assets. He </p>
<p>suffers 2d6 damage, but adds +2 to his side’s </p>
<p>Battle Roll.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Two  Raises:</b> The  warrior  covers  himself  in </p>
<p>glory! Scores of foes fall before him and his </p>
<p>success inspires his allies to fight like demons. </p>
<p>His efforts add +2 to his side’s Battle Roll and </p>
<p>he emerges from the fight unscathed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Ammo:</b> If it’s important to track, each round a </p>
<p>hero enters the fray and uses his Shooting or an </p>
<p>arcane skill (such as Spellcasting), he expends </p>
<p>some of his ammunition or Power Points.</p>
<p>Arcane types use 2d6 Power Points per round. </p>
<p>Characters with ranged weapons use 3d6 shots </p>
<p>for ranged weapons (triple that for weapons that </p>
<p>usually fire bursts or full-auto). If the hero winds </p>
<p>up without any ammo or Power Points she’ll have </p>
<p>to change tactics for the next round.</p>
<p>Battle.Aftermath</p>
<p>When  one  side  routs,  retreats,  or  runs  out </p>
<p>of  tokens,  the  battle  ends  and  casualties  are </p>
<p>removed. Some of the troops lost in the battle can </p>
<p>be recovered as they regroup or receive first aid.</p>
<p>If it’s important to know how things stand after </p>
<p>the fight, roll 1d6 for each token lost. The victor </p>
<p>recovers a lost token on a roll of 4-6. The loser </p>
<p>recovers a lost token on a roll of 5-6. A routed army </p>
<p>recovers tokens only on a roll of 6.</p>
<p>After the battle and once both sides have figured </p>
<p>out how many tokens they lost, remove the actual </p>
<p>casualties from their armies. The side that started </p>
<p>with the larger force simply multiplies the number </p>
<p>of  tokens  lost  by  10%.  Losing  four  tokens,  for </p>
<p>example,  means  the  entire  army  suffered  40% </p>
<p>casualties. The side with the smaller force must </p>
<p>figure out what percentage of his men are left. If </p>
<p>he started with 8 tokens and ends up with only 2, </p>
<p>for example, he’s lost 75% of his force.</p>
<p>Once  you’ve  figured  the  total  percentage  of </p>
<p>casualties  to  your  army,  distribute  the  losses </p>
<p>among specific units as evenly as possible.</p>
<p>Example:.The.Invasion.of.Earth</p>
<p>The insectoid Gorram Empire is conducting a </p>
<p>planetary assault of Earth. The Gorram have 10 </p>
<p>tokens that represent their massive invasion fleet </p>
<p>and armored walkers with fiery death rays. Earth </p>
<p>has  all  the  world’s  militaries  at  their  disposal. </p>
<p>Given the superiority of Gorram technology and </p>
<p>greater  numbers,  the  GM  decides  the  Earth </p>
<p>Defense Force (EDF) gets 8 tokens.</p>
<p>Both sides have heavy artillery and air support </p>
<p>(+3  to  both  sides),  but  there  are  no  terrain </p>
<p>advantages since it’s a world-wide battle.</p>
<p>The  Gorram  Empire  makes  a  Knowledge </p>
<p>(Battle) roll and gets a 13. The player characters </p>
<p>load up in stratospheric fighters and lend a hand. </p>
<p>Collectively, they suffer some damage but also </p>
<p>add  a  grand  total  of  +3  to  the  roll. The  EDF’s </p>
<p>Knowledge (Battle) final total is 17—Earth wins </p>
<p>by 4. That destroys two of the invaders’ tokens </p>
<p>and 20% of their force.</p>
<p>The Game Master describes the first few hours </p>
<p>of the invasion and a spirited defense by earth’s </p>
<p>militaries. The  evil  insectoids  are  dealt  heavy </p>
<p>losses, but are far from defeated, and the battle </p>
<p>goes on.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>

<p>Setting.Rules</p>
<p>There are many Savage Worlds with settings </p>
<p>ranging  from  dark  and  gritty  detective  tales  to </p>
<p>cinematic epics to political thrillers. These rules </p>
<p>provide a great framework for anything you want </p>
<p>to do but adding the right setting rules really bring </p>
<p>the world and the action to life.</p>
<p>Blood.&amp;.Guts</p>
<p>Characters  can  spend  Bennies  on  damage </p>
<p>rolls!  Use  this rule  when  you  really  want to up </p>
<p>the carnage.</p>
<p>Born.A.Hero</p>
<p>During character creation, heroes may ignore </p>
<p>the  Rank  qualifications  for  Edges. They  must </p>
<p>still have any other requirements as usual. The </p>
<p>usual rules for Rank requirements apply after the </p>
<p>character is created.</p>
<p>Critical.Failures</p>
<p>This  rule  works  well  for  very  dark  or  very </p>
<p>humorous games. When a character rolls double </p>
<p>1’s on a Trait roll, he can’t spend a Benny—he’s </p>
<p>stuck with the critical failure.</p>
<p>Fanatics</p>
<p>Use this rule in pulp-style games where villains </p>
<p>are  larger  than  life.  When  a  Wild  Card  enemy </p>
<p>character is hit by a successful attack, any of his </p>
<p>henchmen, goons, or other allies jumps in front of </p>
<p>his master and suffers the attack instead.</p>
<p>Gritty.Damage</p>
<p>This variation on damage works well for settings </p>
<p>such  as  gritty  detective  scenarios  or  “realistic” </p>
<p>military adventures. It can be very lethal so use </p>
<p>it cautiously.</p>
<p>Treat Extras’ wounds normally.</p>
<p>For Wild Cards, count wounds as usual and go </p>
<p>through the normal steps for Incapacitation should </p>
<p>he accumulate more than three wounds.</p>
<p>In addition, every time the hero suffers a wound, </p>
<p>roll  on  the  Injury  Table  and  apply  the  results </p>
<p>immediately  (but  roll  only  once  per  incident </p>
<p>regardless  of  how  many  wounds  are  actually </p>
<p>caused). A  hero  who  takes  2  wounds  from  an </p>
<p>attack, for example, still only suffers one roll on </p>
<p>the Injury Table.</p>
<p>Injuries sustained in this way are cured when </p>
<p>the  wound  is  healed.  (Injuries  sustained  via </p>
<p>Incapacitation may be temporary or permanent </p>
<p>as usual.)</p>
<p>A  Shaken  character  who’s  Shaken  a  second </p>
<p>time from a damaging attack receives a wound as </p>
<p>usual but does <i>not</i> have to roll on the Injury Table.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--109</p>
<p>Situational.Rules</p>
<p><i><b>Example:</b>  Sergeant  Trotter  is  a  hero  in </i></p>
<p><i>Weird  Wars.  He  takes  a  wound  from  a </i></p>
<p><i>German sniper, doesn’t Soak it, and so has </i></p>
<p><i>to roll on the Injury Table. He rolls a 10—Leg. </i></p>
<p><i>The GM rolls a die and decides it’s the left </i></p>
<p><i>leg. Trotter is now Lame. If he takes another </i></p>
<p><i>wound to that leg, he’d have the One Leg </i></p>
<p><i>Hindrance. Further wounds to the same leg </i></p>
<p><i>add to his wound total as usual but have no </i></p>
<p><i>further effect as there’s nothing beyond the </i></p>
<p><i>One Leg Hindrance.</i></p>
<p><i>Later,  the  unfortunate  Sarge  takes  two </i></p>
<p><i>wounds to the Guts. The Game Master rolls </i></p>
<p><i>once and gets the Battered result, reducing </i></p>
<p><i>the Sarge’s Vigor from d8 to d6. Note that </i></p>
<p><i>while  the  attack  caused  two  wounds,  the </i></p>
<p><i>Game Master only rolled once on the Injury </i></p>
<p><i>Table since it was one attack.</i></p>
<p>Heroes.Never.Die</p>
<p>Heroes in movies very rarely die. And when they </p>
<p>do, they go down fighting or perform one last, epic </p>
<p>act of heroism. With this rule in play, heroes who </p>
<p>would normally die are simply knocked out for a </p>
<p>dramatically appropriate time instead. Only if the </p>
<p>situation is particularly heroic, or if it serves as </p>
<p>a major story point can characters actually die.</p>
<p>An  adventurer  who  falls  into  a  volcano,  for </p>
<p>example, might land on a floating piece of rock and </p>
<p>leapfrog to safety. Conversely, if a hero confronts a </p>
<p>massive demon on a crumbling bridge and suffers </p>
<p>what would normally be a mortal wound, perhaps </p>
<p>he does perish but the Game Master decides with </p>
<p>his final blow he takes the demon into the boiling </p>
<p>lava with him, allowing his companions to escape.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Villains:</b> Of course the reverse of this rule is </p>
<p>also  true—villains  never  die  either! The  Game </p>
<p>Master  will  need  to  explain  the  spirit  of  these </p>
<p>rules to the group so their characters don’t take </p>
<p>advantage of it by doing something gruesome and </p>
<p>fatal to a fallen villain. In Heroes Never Die, the </p>
<p>party is assumed to capture their rivals and turn </p>
<p>them over to the authorities—where of course they </p>
<p>eventually escape to return again.</p>
<p>High.Adventure</p>
<p>  Characters  can  spend  a  Benny  to  gain </p>
<p>a  one-time  use  of  a  Combat  Edge.  Player </p>
<p>Characters have to meet the Rank and any Edge </p>
<p>requirements, but can ignore Trait requirements </p>
<p>for  this  one-time  use.  Multiple  bennies  can  be </p>
<p>spent in one round for multiple Edges, either for </p>
<p>different  effects  or  in  order  to  meet  a  needed </p>
<p>requirement to gain another Edge.</p>
<p>Joker’s.Wild</p>
<p>This is a great rule to add to your game if you’re </p>
<p>the kind of Game Master who’s a little stingy in </p>
<p>awarding Bennies. It slightly ups the heroics and </p>
<p>is a lot of fun for the group.</p>
<p>When a player character draws a Joker during </p>
<p>combat, he receives his normal +2 bonus to Trait </p>
<p>and damage rolls. In addition, all player characters </p>
<p>receive a Benny!</p>
<p>Multiple.Languages</p>
<p>Some settings feature characters and cultures </p>
<p>who typically speak many different languages. If </p>
<p>this Setting Rule is in play, your hero knows his </p>
<p>cultural or national language plus an additional </p>
<p>number  of  languages  equal  to  half  his  Smarts </p>
<p>die. An elf with a d8 Smarts in a swords &amp; sorcery </p>
<p>campaign,  for  example,  knows  Elvish  and  four </p>
<p>other languages—perhaps human, dwarven, and </p>
<p>two others of her choosing.</p>
<p>No.Power.Points</p>
<p>Instead of using Power Points, characters with </p>
<p>Arcane  Backgrounds  simply  choose  the  power </p>
<p>they want to activate and make an arcane skill roll. </p>
<p>The penalty to the roll is half the power’s usual </p>
<p>Power  Point  cost  (rounded  down).  Casting  the </p>
<p><i>armor</i> power, for example, which costs 2 Power </p>
<p>Points, is an arcane skill roll at –1.</p>
<p>Once cast, check the results below:</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Success:</b> The power activates as usual.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Raise:</b> A raise on the roll grants any additional </p>
<p>bonuses to the power stated in its description. </p>
<p><i>Armor, </i> for  example,  grants  a  +4  bonus  to </p>
<p>Toughness with a raise.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Failure:</b> All currently maintained powers are </p>
<p>cancelled and the caster is Shaken.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Backlash:</b>  Channeling  magic,  spiritual,  or </p>
<p>psionic energy, tinkering with unstable technology, </p>
<p>and even using superpowers all come with certain </p>
<p>risks.</p>
<p>If a caster rolls a 1 on the arcane skill die when </p>
<p>using one of his powers it automatically fails and </p>
<p>he suffers 2d6 damage.</p>
<p>Replace each Arcane Background’s specialized </p>
<p>backlash rules with these:</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Magic:</b> Use the above Backlash results.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Miracles:</b> As  above,  but  the  damage  is </p>
<p>reduced by half the priest’s Faith skill.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Psionics:</b> Use the above Backlash rules, but </p>
<p>the damage is applied to all sentient creatures </p>
<p>within a Large Burst Template centered on the </p>
<p>psionicist. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--110</p>
<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Super  Powers:</b>  The  hero  does  not  suffer </p>
<p>damage, but cannot use the power for the rest </p>
<p>of this encounter or until he spends a Benny </p>
<p>to negate the Backlash.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Weird Science:</b> As above and the “device” is </p>
<p>destroyed and must be rebuilt. This typically </p>
<p>takes 1d3+1 hours, minus one hour for every </p>
<p>success and raise on the Repair roll.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Maintaining  Powers:</b>  Characters  can </p>
<p>maintain  powers  as  long  as  desired,  but  each </p>
<p>power maintained inflicts a –1 to cast any new </p>
<p>powers. Thus  an  invisible  mage  can  keep  the </p>
<p>power going indefinitely, but suffers a –1 penalty </p>
<p>if he then attempts to hurl a <i>bolt</i>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Interrupting Powers:</b> If a character with an </p>
<p>activated  power  is  Shaken  or  suffers  a  wound </p>
<p>or  Fatigue  level,  he  must  make  a  Smarts  roll </p>
<p>to  maintain  all  his  powers.  If  the  roll  is  failed, </p>
<p>all powers are instantly dropped. A wizard with </p>
<p><i>armor</i> who suffers a Shaken result, for example, </p>
<p>must make a Smarts roll. If the wizard suffers two </p>
<p>wounds from an attack, he must make a Smarts </p>
<p>roll at –2.</p>
<p>Powers shut down automatically if the caster </p>
<p>sleeps or is rendered unconscious.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Power Preparation:</b> A caster may prepare a </p>
<p>spell by concentrating for a round (no movement </p>
<p>or  other  actions  and  avoid  interruption,  as </p>
<p>described  above).  If  successful,  he  ignores  2 </p>
<p>points  of  penalties  on  all  powers  cast  with  his </p>
<p>next action. If he does not enact any powers on </p>
<p>his next action, the preparation is lost.</p>
<p>Skill.Specialization</p>
<p><i>Savage Worlds</i> skills are intended to be broad, </p>
<p>allowing characters to focus primarily on Edges </p>
<p>for customization rather than multiple iterations </p>
<p>of  something  like  Fighting  for  edged  weapons, </p>
<p>Fighting for blunt weapons, etc.</p>
<p>If  it’s  important  to  your  setting  to  have  more </p>
<p>detail, a character uses his normal skill for one </p>
<p>device of choice. When using any other variation </p>
<p>he suffers a –2 penalty.</p>
<p>Gaining  an  additional  specialization  counts </p>
<p>as raising a skill below its linked Attribute. So a </p>
<p>character can gain two new specializations with </p>
<p>an Advance, or gain a specialization and increase </p>
<p>a skill below its linked Attribute.</p>
<p>Below are skills appropriate for this extra detail </p>
<p>and some example specializations:</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Boating:</b> Powered, Sailed, Steam</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Driving:</b> Hover, Tracked, Wheeled</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Fighting:</b> Axe,  Blunt  Weapon,  Exotic  (such </p>
<p>as nunchaku; each is separate), Long blade, </p>
<p>Pole arm, Short blade.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Piloting:</b> Fixed Wing, Rotary, Space</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Riding:</b> Camel, Horse, etc.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Shooting:</b>  Bow,  Crossbow,  Pistol,  Rifle, </p>
<p>Shotgun, etc.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Survival:</b> Arctic, Desert, Temperate</p>
<p>Social.Conflict</p>
<p>Not every conflict is won by the blade. Successful </p>
<p>oratory can topple nations. </p>
<p>The following system works well for protracted </p>
<p>and dramatic negotiations, such as convincing a </p>
<p>council to send troops to a noble’s lands, winning </p>
<p>a court case, or tricking a guard into opening the </p>
<p>gates to the space station.</p>
<p>The conflict is broken down into three rounds </p>
<p>of conversation, each focusing on one particular </p>
<p>point (or a few highly connected points). Further </p>
<p>rounds  represent  the  turn  of  conversation  to </p>
<p>additional points.</p>
<p>Each  round,  the  player  character  roleplays </p>
<p>his  argument  and  makes  a  Persuasion  roll  (or </p>
<p>an opposed Persuasion roll if a rival is arguing </p>
<p>against him).</p>
<p>A  speaker  accumulates  a  success  for  each </p>
<p>success and raise on the Persuasion roll (it’s best </p>
<p>to keep track of this with tokens).</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--111</p>
<p>Situational.Rules</p>
<p>At the end of the third round of conflict, the side </p>
<p>with the most successes “wins” the argument. The </p>
<p>more successes, the more convinced the target to </p>
<p>be persuaded is, as shown on the Social Conflict </p>
<p>Table below.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Modifiers:</b> The  Game  Master  should  grant </p>
<p>a +2 bonus to a side that makes a particularly </p>
<p>brilliant  or  undeniable  point;  or  a  –2  penalty  if </p>
<p>the speaker commits a faux pas, such as making </p>
<p>a  provably  untrue  statement  or  insulting  the </p>
<p>audience he hopes to convince.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Knowledge Is Power:</b> If the characters are </p>
<p>arguing technical points, such as a legal battle </p>
<p>or  the  best  plan  for  a  kingdom’s  defense,  the </p>
<p>character must roll the lowest of his Persuasion </p>
<p>or appropriate Knowledge roll. So for example a </p>
<p>lawyer with a Persuasion of d10 and Knowledge </p>
<p>(Law) of d4, would roll d4. It always pays to know </p>
<p>what you’re talking about.</p>

<p>Tie </p>
<p>The issue is unsettled and no action is </p>
<p>taken until new and more compelling </p>
<p>evidence can be presented to reopen </p>
<p>the  negotiation.  In  a  court  case,  the </p>
<p>defense  would  win  as  the  burden  of </p>
<p>proof is on the prosecution.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1-2 </p>
<p>The  target  isn’t  truly  convinced  but </p>
<p>decides it’s better to be safe than sorry. </p>
<p>He  provides  the  minimum  amount  of </p>
<p>support possible. In a court case, the </p>
<p>jury  barely  finds  reasonable  doubt  if </p>
<p>the defense wins, or assigns minimal </p>
<p>sentencing if the prosecution wins.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3-4 </p>
<p>The target is reasonably convinced. He </p>
<p>grants  the  help  requested,  more  or </p>
<p>less, but may have conditions or ask </p>
<p>favors  in  return.  In  a  court  case,  the </p>
<p>judge invokes severe sentencing if the </p>
<p>prosecution wins. If the defense wins </p>
<p>the defendant is cleared of all charges.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>5+ </p>
<p>The  target  is  sure  of  his  decision.  He </p>
<p>provides more support than requested. </p>
<p>If the prosecution wins in a court case, </p>
<p>the defendant receives the maximum </p>
<p>penalty.</p>
<p>.Example:.To.Arms!</p>
<p>Orcs have invaded multiple baronies across the </p>
<p>kingdom. The hero is a young noble attempting </p>
<p>to convince the king to send royal troops to his </p>
<p>aid. The king is disinclined to send his troops as </p>
<p>a rebellion is also near-at-hand.</p>
<p>The young noble begins by telling the king of his </p>
<p>own battles against the orcs and the depredations </p>
<p>they  have  committed  across  the  kingdom.  He </p>
<p>makes  his  Persuasion  roll  and  gets  a  7.  One </p>
<p>success.</p>
<p>The noble next presents his scouts who tell the </p>
<p>king which baronies the orcs have been spotted </p>
<p>in. The noble rolls again and gets a 9 for a total </p>
<p>of three successes.</p>
<p>Finally, the young warrior reminds the king that </p>
<p>it was his family that supported his coronation, </p>
<p>subtly  implying  that  a  debt  is  owed. This  time, </p>
<p>the noble fails.</p>
<p>With three total successes, the king agrees to </p>
<p>send a token force of infantry, but will not send his </p>
<p>more loyal mounted knights. One of the infantry </p>
<p>commanders, an old friend of noble’s family, is </p>
<p>likely to rebel in the coming revolt, so the king </p>
<p>not  only  sends  him  to  the  noble’s  aid  but  also </p>
<p>instructs an assassin to ensure he doesn’t return! </p>
<p>The Game Master now has a new subplot to work </p>
<p>into his adventure as the heroes try to prevent the </p>
<p>assassination of their friend—and the commander </p>
<p>of their allied troops.</p>
<p>Travel</p>
<p>Most  epic  tales  feature  trips  across  great </p>
<p>expanses—whether  it’s  the  Hobbits’  quest  to </p>
<p>Mordor in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> books or warping </p>
<p>across space in a hard science-fiction tale. This </p>
<p>section  helps  you  figure  out  how  long  these </p>
<p>journeys  might  take  and  what  might  dramatic </p>
<p>events might happen along the way.</p>
<p>Time.and.Distance</p>
<p>Land.Travel.by.Foot.or.Mount</p>
<p>A creature or character’s Base Speed is half its </p>
<p>Pace in miles per hour, with a minimum of ½ mile </p>
<p>per hour. A human with a Pace of 6, for example, </p>
<p>walks about 3 miles per hour.</p>
<p>Groups  move  at  the  speed  of  their  slowest </p>
<p>member.  Fatigue  and  Encumbrance  penalties </p>
<p>don’t normally modify Pace, but the Game Master </p>
<p>may  choose  to  apply  them  when  calculating </p>
<p>overland  movement  rates  if  it’s  dramatically </p>
<p>appropriate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Flying Speeds:</b> Travelers with the luxury of </p>
<p>flying mounts or some other means of leaving the </p>
<p>ground behind may ignore the modifiers below and </p>
<p>may be able to take shorter routes than the land-</p>
<p>bound. Game Masters may adjust airspeeds for </p>
<p>headwinds, thin air, smoke, or other aeronautical </p>
<p>phenomena.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>

<p>Vehicular.Travel</p>
<p>For  reasonably  paced  travel  over  the  course </p>
<p>of one or more days, just use the vehicle’s Top </p>
<p>Speed as its average miles per hour.</p>
<p>Multiply Top  Speed  by  the  number  of  hours </p>
<p>traveled (eight per day being typical) to see how </p>
<p>far a vehicle can travel in one day. For example, </p>
<p>a vehicle with a Top Speed of 40 could travel 320 </p>
<p>miles in 8 hours. </p>
<p>Multiply  the  mileage  by  1.5  for  interstate  or </p>
<p>autobahn travel, or by .5 if traveling over difficult </p>
<p>terrain  such  as  clogged  highways  in  a  post-</p>
<p>apocalyptic aftermath, lack of roads, etc.</p>
<p>Sailing.Ships</p>
<p>Powered  vessels  use  the  same  system  as </p>
<p>Vehicles, above. Sailing ships require more work </p>
<p>on  the  part  of  the  crew.  Each  day,  the  ship’s </p>
<p>captain makes a Boating roll, plus or minus any </p>
<p>modifiers the Game Master feels are appropriate </p>
<p>for  strong  or  weak  winds,  currents,  traveling </p>
<p>upriver,  and  so  on. These  rates  are  based  on </p>
<p>eight-hour stretches, but sailing ships with enough </p>
<p>crew don’t usually stop, so multiply the results by </p>
<p>three if the vessel sails the entire 24-hour period.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Total  of  1  or  Less:</b> The  craft  is  becalmed, </p>
<p>goes in circles, or is effectively lost. It makes no </p>
<p>progress that day and must make a Knowledge </p>
<p>(Navigation) roll the following day or sail in a </p>
<p>direction other than intended.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Failure:</b> 3 x Top Speed in miles traveled</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Success:</b> 10 x Top Speed in miles traveled</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Raise:</b> 15 x Top Speed in miles traveled</p>
<p>Encounters</p>
<p>Unless  the  area  traveled  is  patrolled,  draw </p>
<p>a  card  from  the Action  Deck  once  per  day  (or </p>
<p>whatever  period  the  Game  Master  feels  is </p>
<p>dramatically appropriate for the current scene). A </p>
<p>face card or higher represents an encounter, and </p>
<p>the card suit can be used to determine the type.</p>
<p>Game  Masters  are  highly  encouraged  to </p>
<p>customize encounters based on their setting.</p>
<p>Encounter.Table</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Clubs—Obstacle:</b> The heroes encounter an </p>
<p>obstacle  of  some  kind  and  must  figure  out </p>
<p>how  to  circumvent  it.  Some  examples  are </p>
<p>a flooded river, minefields, a decaying rope </p>
<p>bridge, whirlpool, etc. The obstacle might also </p>
<p>be defended by creatures or enemies as well.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Hearts—NPCs:</b>  The  group  comes  upon </p>
<p>neutral or friendly nonplayer characters such </p>
<p>as merchants, lost travelers, a guide, or even </p>
<p>other adventurers.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Diamonds—Fortune:</b>  Somewhere  along </p>
<p>the  way  is  something  of  value—the  hulk  of </p>
<p>a spaceship full of supplies, a small treasure </p>
<p>cache, a vein of useful or valuable minerals, </p>
<p>or a minor magic item in the clutches of some </p>
<p>unfortunate corpse. </p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Spades—Enemies:</b>  Monsters,  enemies,  or </p>
<p>hostile beasts bar the way. Perhaps they lie </p>

<p>Vehicles</p>
<p>From armored combat in World War II to ship-</p>
<p>to-ship battles on the high seas, vehicles often </p>
<p>play a key role in the furious action of our Savage </p>
<p>Settings. The following section contains rules for </p>
<p>handling  vehicle  combat  on  the  table-top.  For </p>
<p>more abstract Chases that take place over larger </p>
<p>areas, see page 94.</p>
<p>Movement</p>
<p>A  vehicle’s Acceleration  value  is  how  many </p>
<p>inches per turn it can increase its current speed. </p>
<p>A pickup with an Acceleration of 5, for instance, </p>
<p>can  increase its movement by  5”  every action, </p>
<p>up to its Top Speed. A vehicle can decrease its </p>
<p>speed by twice its Acceleration (or more in a Hard </p>
<p>Brake—see Maneuvers).</p>
<p>The player controlling the vehicle decides his </p>
<p>speed at the beginning of his action, and moves </p>
<p>it that many inches. The vehicle remains at that </p>
<p>speed until the driver’s next action, so record the </p>
<p>current speed somewhere for the next round and </p>
<p>in case it hits something.</p>
<p>Vehicles have some restrictions on maneuvering, </p>
<p>particularly  in  how  they  turn.  Use  the Turning </p>
<p>Template for normal turns, or perform a maneuver </p>
<p>(see below) for tighter moves.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Action Cards:</b> Vehicles move on their driver’s </p>
<p>Action Card. Driving is a free action unless the </p>
<p>driver attempts a maneuver. Passengers act on </p>
<p>their own initiative as usual.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Speed Kills:</b> It’s much easier to maneuver a </p>
<p>vehicle slowly than it is at high speed. A vehicle </p>
<p>moving over 15” a round on the tabletop inflicts a </p>
<p>–2 handling penalty on its driver. A vehicle moving </p>
<p>over 30” inflicts a –4 penalty.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Difficult  Ground:</b>  Slippery  gravel,  uneven </p>
<p>ground, and mud are all difficult ground and work </p>
<p>just as for characters on foot. Count each inch </p>
<p>moved through such rough terrain as two, and </p>
<p>apply a –2 penalty to all Driving rolls made while </p>
<p>in  rough  terrain.  Driving  through  rough  terrain </p>
<p>at over half of Top Speed requires a Driving roll </p>
<p>every round.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Reverse: </b>A vehicle can move up to half its </p>
<p>Top Speed in reverse. Driving rolls made while in </p>
<p>reverse suffer a –2 modifier.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--114</p>
<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Turning</p>
<p>To perform turns when using miniatures on the table-top, use the Turning Template found at the </p>
<p>back of this book. Simply line your vehicle up with the template and move it along the outside, as </p>
<p>shown in the Turning diagram. Vehicles can perform tighter turns as a Maneuver (see Maneuvers).</p>
<p>The car here is performing a turn to the left. This is the </p>
<p>most it can turn without performing a maneuver.</p>
<p>The car has </p>
<p>moved 5”. This is </p>
<p>its position at the </p>
<p>end of its move.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Aircraft: </b> Aircraft  ignore  terrain.  Unless  the </p>
<p>aircraft has the ability to hover, it must move at </p>
<p>least half its Top Speed each action. Climb isn’t </p>
<p>used in table-top battles—only in Chases.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Animals  and  Conveyances:</b> Animals  don’t </p>
<p>have to worry about Acceleration or Top Speed—</p>
<p>they simply move their Pace (plus any running </p>
<p>roll) each round. Animal-drawn transportation has </p>
<p>an Acceleration equal to half the animal’s basic </p>
<p>Pace. Carts and wagons don’t have a Top Speed </p>
<p>because  the  animal  simply  moves  its  Pace  as </p>
<p>usual (plus a running die if it runs).</p>
<p>Maneuvers</p>
<p>Below are some common maneuvers with any </p>
<p>penalty to the Driving roll listed in parentheses. </p>
<p>If the maneuver is failed, move the vehicle to the </p>
<p>point  of  the  maneuver,  then  roll  on  the  Out  of </p>
<p>Control Table to see where it actually ends up.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Bootlegger Reverse (–4):</b> The vehicle moves </p>
<p>forward at half its current speed and then turns </p>
<p>between 90 and 180 degrees (player’s choice). </p>
<p>The vehicle instantly decelerates to a complete </p>
<p>stop and cannot move further this round.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Hard Brake (0):</b> The driver decelerates up to </p>
<p>three times the vehicle’s Acceleration.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Jump  (0):</b>  With  a  ramp,  ground  and  water </p>
<p>vehicles can jump a distance equal to one-</p>
<p>quarter of their current speed, plus 1d10” with </p>
<p>a raise on the Driving roll. They descend one </p>
<p>inch for every two inches jumped forward, so </p>
<p>a vehicle jumping 20” falls 10” by the end of </p>
<p>its jump.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Maneuver (–1 to –4):</b> This one covers most </p>
<p>everything else a driver, rider, or pilot might try </p>
<p>to do, such as riding a horse down a steep or </p>
<p>slippery hill, avoiding a manhole cover or other </p>
<p>obstacle, or driving through an oil slick at high </p>
<p>speed. The GM sets the modifier. If the roll is </p>
<p>failed, the driver goes out of control as usual.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Obstacle  (–2  or  more):</b>  Driving  through  a </p>
<p>really  tight  obstacle  looks  easy  enough  on </p>
<p>the tabletop since a vehicle is simply moved </p>
<p>however the player wants. But in “reality,” the </p>
<p>car is shifting around and is much more difficult </p>
<p>to hold steady than the table-top shows. For </p>
<p>this reason, drivers trying to pass through tight </p>
<p>obstacles—narrow  alleys,  other  cars,  flying </p>
<p>under power lines—must make Driving rolls. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--115</p>
<p>Situational.Rules</p>
<p>The standard difficulty is –2, but really tight </p>
<p>spots might call for a –4 or greater penalty. If </p>
<p>the roll is failed, the vehicle hits the obstacle </p>
<p>and suffers collision damage as usual.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Ram (Opposed):</b> Though we have to move </p>
<p>vehicles  in  turns  on  the  table-top,  they’re </p>
<p>actually  moving  simultaneously  in  the  “real </p>
<p>world.” For that reason, when one car rams </p>
<p>another,  we  give  the  defender  a  chance  to </p>
<p>get out of the way—even if it’s not his turn. </p>
<p>When  this  happens,  the  two  drivers  make </p>
<p>opposed  Driving  rolls.  If  the  attacker  wins, </p>
<p>he’s  managed  to  ram  his  foe  and  damage </p>
<p>is calculated normally. If the defender wins, </p>
<p>he must move his vehicle just out of the way, </p>
<p>whether  backwards,  forwards,  or  sideways. </p>
<p>Sometimes  cars  run  into  people  as  well.  In </p>
<p>this case, the driver makes an opposed roll </p>
<p>against the target’s Agility instead.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Tight Turn (0): </b>The vehicle can turn up to 90 </p>
<p>degrees.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Two  Wheels  (–4): </b> Sometimes  a  character </p>
<p>needs to put a wheeled vehicle on its side, </p>
<p>maybe to squeeze through a narrow alley or </p>
<p>avoid  running  over  some  deadly  obstacle. </p>
<p>Turning a vehicle up on two wheels requires </p>
<p>a ramp of some kind—even an embankment </p>
<p>can do the trick. The effect is to decrease the </p>
<p>width of the car—usually by about 25%. The </p>
<p>driver must make a Driving roll at the beginning </p>
<p>of each turn he wants to keep the car up on </p>
<p>two wheels.</p>
<p>Collisions</p>
<p>Collisions are very deadly in <i>Savage Worlds.</i> </p>
<p>The damage to the vehicle and its passengers </p>
<p>is  1d6  for  every  5”  of  its  current  speed  (round </p>
<p>normally). If a motorcycle moving at 16” per turn </p>
<p>hits a tree, for instance, it suffers 3d6 damage, as </p>
<p>does its rider and anything it rams into.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Relative  Speeds:</b>  Increase  the  damage  if </p>
<p>a  vehicle  hits  another  object  moving  toward  it. </p>
<p>This is called “relative speed.” If two tanks ram </p>
<p>into  each other  at  a  speed of 12,  for instance, </p>
<p>their relative speed is actually 24 and each tank </p>
<p>suffers 4d6 damage. Similarly, a vehicle moving </p>
<p>away from an attacker subtracts its speed from </p>
<p>the ramming vehicle’s.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Vehicular Armor: </b>Vehicles with Heavy Armor </p>
<p>add  their Armor  rating  as  an AP  value  to  their </p>
<p>damage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Safety  Harnesses:</b> A  seat  belt  protects </p>
<p>anyone wearing it. Roll half the normal damage </p>
<p>dice (round down) for these characters. Do the </p>
<p>same for air bags, but subtract one additional die </p>
<p>of damage as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Soft Obstacles:</b> The collision rules assume </p>
<p>the vehicle has hit something hard, like another </p>
<p>vehicle, rock, wall, and so on. If the obstacle was </p>
<p>soft, like a person, the damage is halved for the </p>
<p>vehicle. The person takes damage normally, of </p>
<p>course.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Falling  or  Jumping  From  Vehicles:</b> </p>
<p>Characters  who  fall  from  a  moving  vehicle </p>
<p>suffer damage just as if they were in a collision. </p>
<p>Characters  who  jump  and  make  an Agility  roll </p>
<p>suffer half the usual damage dice (round down). </p>
<p>If a character jumps out of a boat, treat this as </p>
<p>nonlethal damage.</p>
<p>Losing.Control</p>
<p>Failing  a  Driving  roll  causes  a  vehicle  to  go </p>
<p>“out of control.” When this happens, roll 2d6 on </p>
<p>the Out of Control Table. Resolve any additional </p>
<p>movement  (such  as  slips  or  flips)  immediately. </p>
<p>Anything  in  the  way  gets  smashed—check  out </p>
<p>the collision rules above if that happens.</p>
<p>Vehicular.Attacks</p>
<p>Combat between vehicles and their crews works </p>
<p>just like regular combat but with two additional </p>
<p>modifiers.</p>
<p>Attack.Modifiers</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Penalty</b> </p>
<p><b>Situation</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>–2 </p>
<p>Unstable Platform</p>
<p> </p>
<p>–1 per 10” of Speed </p>
<p>Fast Targets</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Unstable  Platform: </b> Any  character  on  an </p>
<p>unstable  platform,  including  a  moving  vehicle, </p>
<p>suffers a –2 penalty to any “fine” physical skills </p>
<p>such as Fighting and Shooting. This applies to </p>
<p>characters who are firing vehicular weapons as </p>
<p>well. Note that the Steady Hands Edge eliminates </p>
<p>this penalty.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Fast  Target: </b> A  fast-moving  vehicle  is  more </p>
<p>difficult to hit, and subtracts 1 from any attacks </p>
<p>directed at it for every full 10” of its speed. This </p>
<p>is relative, so a vehicle heading directly toward a </p>
<p>character doesn’t get the modifier, nor does the </p>
<p>modifier apply if the hero is shooting at a vehicle </p>
<p>driving parallel to his own.</p>
<p>Damage</p>
<p>Damage that equals or exceeds the vehicle’s </p>
<p>Toughness forces  the  driver  to make  a  Driving </p>
<p>roll or go Out of Control (roll on the Out of Control </p>
<p>Table).</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--116</p>
<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p>Each  raise  on  the  damage  roll  also  inflicts  a </p>
<p>“wound.” Each wound caused to the vehicle inflicts </p>
<p>a –1 penalty to the driver’s Driving skill rolls until </p>
<p>someone repairs the damage. The attacker also </p>
<p>scores a critical hit for each wound inflicted, and </p>
<p>rolls on the Critical Hit Table to find out exactly </p>
<p>what happened.</p>
<p>When  a  vehicle  takes  its  fourth  wound,  it  is </p>
<p>automatically wrecked and the driver must make </p>
<p>a Driving roll or go out of control.</p>
<p>A wrecked vehicle won’t run anymore, though </p>
<p>its weapons may still be able to fire if they aren’t </p>
<p>powered by the vehicle’s propulsion system.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Wrecked Aircraft:</b> If an aircraft goes Out of </p>
<p>Control, don’t use the usual table. Instead, the </p>
<p>pilot makes a Piloting roll. If he fails, the aircraft </p>
<p>crashes and is destroyed. If the pilot can eject, he </p>
<p>gets one chance to do so by making an Agility roll.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Wrecked  Watercraft:</b>  Unless  the  vessel  is </p>
<p>cracked open and sinks instantly, a wrecked boat </p>
<p>sinks at the following rate:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Small craft (rowboats, canoes) sink at the </p>
<p>end of the round in which they’re wrecked.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Medium craft, such as a fishing boat, sink in </p>
<p>1d6 minutes.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Large craft, such as a private yacht, sink in </p>
<p>4d6 minutes.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Ships, such as oil tankers, cruise ships, or </p>
<p>naval vessels, sink in 2d6 hours.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A wrecked boat that hasn’t sunk drifts with </p>
<p>the current (if any). This is typically 2d6” per </p>
<p>round  for  fast-moving  rivers,  and  1d6”  for </p>
<p>most other rivers or in strong seas. In the </p>
<p>ocean, the GM can roll 1d12 to determine </p>
<p>which direction a vessel drifts.</p>
<p>Repairs</p>
<p>Characters may repair vehicles given sufficient </p>
<p>time and at least some basic tools. This requires </p>
<p>a Repair roll that takes two hours per wound the </p>
<p>vehicle has (regardless of how many are actually </p>
<p>repaired). Attempting  to  fix  up  a  tank  that  has </p>
<p>suffered  two  wounds,  for  example,  takes  four </p>
<p>hours regardless of the result of the Repair roll.</p>
<p>Field work requires at least a toolbox and basic </p>
<p>supplies,  and  subtracts  2  from  the  Repair  roll. </p>
<p>An average garage negates this penalty, and an </p>
<p>excellent or dedicated facility adds +2.</p>
<p>Each success and raise on the Repair roll fixes </p>
<p>one of the vehicle’s wounds. With an additional </p>
<p>raise above and beyond that required to fix all its </p>
<p>wounds, the repair time is halved.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Wrecks:</b>  Wrecked  vehicles  can  also  be </p>
<p>repaired, but it takes much more time and decent </p>
<p>spare parts. The time is equal to 1d6 x 10 hours </p>
<p>per wound level repaired.</p>
<p><i><b>Example: </b>Corporal Tunny has been tasked </i></p>
<p><i>with  patching  the  holes  in  a  B-17  bomber </i></p>
<p><i>with  two  wounds.  He’s  at  the  airbase  with </i></p>
<p><i>a dedicated garage and thus adds +2 to his </i></p>
<p><i>rolls.  Each  attempt  takes  four  hours,  and </i></p>
<p><i>each success and raise removes one wound.</i></p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>2d6 </b></p>
<p><b>Effect</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>2</b> </p>
<p><b>Roll Over:</b> The vehicle performs a Slip and rolls over 1d6 times in that direction. Roll </p>
<p>collision damage for the vehicle and everyone inside. Any exterior-mounted weapons </p>
<p>or accessories are ruined.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>3–4</b> </p>
<p><b>Spin:</b> Move the vehicle 1d6” in the direction of the maneuver, or 1d6” away from a damaging </p>
<p>blow. Roll a d12, read it like a clock facing, and point the vehicle in that direction. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>5-9</b> </p>
<p><b>Skid:</b> Move the vehicle 1d4” left or right (in the direction of a failed maneuver, or away </p>
<p>from a damaging attack).</p>
<p> <b> 10–11</b> </p>
<p><b>Slip:</b> Move the vehicle 1d6” left or right (in the direction of a failed maneuver, or away from </p>
<p>a damaging attack).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>12</b> </p>
<p><b>Flip: </b>The vehicle flips end over end 1d4 times. Move it forward that many increments of </p>
<p>its own length. Roll collision damage for the vehicle, its passengers, and anything it hits. </p>
<p>Slow and heavy vehicles such as tanks (GM’s discretion) don’t flip but suffer a Slip or </p>
<p>Skid instead.</p>

<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>2d6 </b></p>
<p><b>Effect</b></p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>2</b> </p>
<p><b>Scratch and Dent:</b> The attack merely scratches the paint. There’s no permanent damage.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>3</b> </p>
<p><b>Engine:</b> The engine is hit. Oil leaks, pistons misfire, etc. Acceleration is halved (round </p>
<p>down). This does not affect deceleration, however.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>4</b> </p>
<p><b>Locomotion:</b> The wheels, tracks, or whatever have been hit. Halve the vehicle’s Top Speed </p>
<p>immediately. If the vehicle is pulled by animals, the shot hits one of them instead.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>5</b> </p>
<p><b>Controls:</b> The control system is hit. Until a Repair roll is made, the vehicle can only perform </p>
<p>turns to one side (1–3 left, 4–6 right). This may prohibit certain maneuvers as well.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>6–8</b> </p>
<p><b>Chassis:</b> The vehicle suffers a hit in the body with no special effects.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>9–10</b> </p>
<p><b>Crew:</b> A random crew member is hit. The damage from the attack is rerolled. If the character </p>
<p>is inside the vehicle, subtract the vehicle’s Armor from the damage. Damage caused by </p>
<p>an explosion affects all passengers in the vehicle.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>11</b> </p>
<p><b>Weapon:</b> A random weapon on the side of the vehicle that was hit is destroyed and may </p>
<p>no longer be used. If there is no weapon, this is a Chassis hit instead.</p>

<p>Most roleplaying games feature “magic” in one </p>
<p>form or another. Whether it’s hidden occult lore </p>
<p>practiced only by dark cultists, voodoo rituals, the </p>
<p>eldritch sorcery of powerful wizards, weird gadgets </p>
<p>created by mad scientists, superpowers, or the </p>
<p>psionic powers of the mind, these rules handle it </p>
<p>all in one simple system.</p>
<p>For  ease  of  use,  we  call  all  of  these  effects </p>
<p>“powers.”  Best  of  all,  powers  work  the  same </p>
<p>from  game  to  game,  but  the  particular  use </p>
<p>and Trappings  give  the  same  powers  endless </p>
<p>variations. That means you can create wizards, </p>
<p>mad scientists, superheroes, and even creatures </p>
<p>with one simple set of easy-to-remember rules.</p>
<p>Making.Arcane.Characters</p>
<p>Before  we go any  further,  you need to make </p>
<p>sure  your  GM  will  allow  arcane  characters  in </p>
<p>his game. You can’t make a wizard in a realistic </p>
<p>military campaign, and mad scientists might not </p>
<p>fit in every fantasy setting.</p>
<p>Now that that’s out of the way, you need to buy </p>
<p>the Arcane Background Edge and choose which </p>
<p>type of supernatural power your hero is blessed </p>
<p>with.</p>
<p>Five different types of powers are presented in </p>
<p>this rulebook: Magic, Miracles, Psionics, Super </p>
<p>Powers, and Weird Science. All types of powers </p>
<p>use  the  same  basic  mechanics  but  with  a  few </p>
<p>important differences in the details.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about what’s similar before we get into </p>
<p>what’s different.</p>
<p>Arcane.Skill</p>
<p>Each  type  of  power  has  a  particular  arcane </p>
<p>skill:  Faith  for  miracles,  Psionics  for  psionics, </p>
<p>Spellcasting  for  magic,  and  Weird  Science  for </p>
<p>weird  science.  Super  powers  use  skills  a  little </p>
<p>differently, as you’ll see on the following pages.</p>
<p>You  need  to  take  the  listed  skill  for  your </p>
<p>character’s  particular Arcane  Background  and </p>
<p>put points into it as usual. You’ll find the attribute </p>
<p>the  skill  is  linked  to  in  parentheses  beside  the </p>
<p>skill itself.</p>
<p>Power.Points</p>
<p>Arcane characters energize their powers with </p>
<p>“Power Points.” As soon as you buy an Arcane </p>
<p>Background  Edge,  your  hero  gets  the  listed </p>
<p>number of Power Points. </p>
<p>Using a power requires that you spend a number </p>
<p>of these points. Some powers allow you to pay </p>
<p>additional points for better effects, and some allow </p>
<p>you  to  maintain  the  effect  by  spending  Power </p>
<p>Points each round.</p>
<p>Heroes recover 1 Power Point per hour.</p>
<p>Starting.Powers</p>
<p>Arcane characters start with a number of powers </p>
<p>dictated by their particular Arcane Background. </p>
<p>See the Arcane Background list for specifics.</p>
<p>Learning.New.Powers</p>
<p>An arcane character can learn a new power by </p>
<p>selecting the New Power Edge. As soon as he </p>
<p>levels up and chooses this Edge, he can instantly </p>
<p>begin using whichever power he chooses.</p>
<p>Using.Powers</p>
<p>As  an  action,  a  character  may  use  a  single </p>
<p>power by declaring the power he’s using, spending </p>
<p>the desired number of Power Points, and making </p>
<p>an arcane skill roll.</p>
<p>If the roll is failed, there’s no effect but the Power </p>
<p>Points are lost. If successful, consult the particular </p>
<p>power to determine the results.</p>
<p>Some powers have variable effects depending </p>
<p>on how many Power Points are used to cast them. </p>
<p>The player must spend the desired Power Points </p>
<p><i>before</i> rolling his character’s arcane skill to see </p>
<p>if he’s successful.</p>
<p>Maintaining.Powers</p>
<p>Some powers may be maintained, as listed in </p>
<p>the power’s Duration description. This is a free </p>
<p>action. The number following the duration is the </p>
<p>cost in Power Points to keep the power going. </p>
<p>No new skill roll is needed to maintain a power.</p>
<p>For each power currently being maintained, the </p>
<p>Chapter.Five:.</p>
<p>Powers</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--119</p>
<p>caster suffers a –1 to future arcane skill rolls (but </p>
<p>not other Trait tests). A wizard maintaining <i>armor</i> </p>
<p>and <i> charm</i>,  for  example,  suffers  a  –2  penalty </p>
<p>to  his  Spellcasting  rolls  until  he  allows  those </p>
<p>powers to lapse. He does <i>not</i> suffer penalties to </p>
<p>his Fighting (or other) rolls while these spells are </p>
<p>being maintained.</p>
<p>Disruption</p>
<p>A  character  who  is  actively  maintaining  a </p>
<p>power may be disrupted if he suffers damage. To </p>
<p>maintain concentration for <i>all</i> of his powers, the </p>
<p>hero makes one opposed arcane skill roll versus </p>
<p>the damage he suffered. If his roll is higher, he </p>
<p>maintains all of his spells. If he fails, he instantly </p>
<p>drops all of his powers <i>after</i> the attack that caused </p>
<p>the disruption is resolved.</p>
<p>A character who is Shaken by non-damaging </p>
<p>means  (such  as  a Test  of  Wills)  must  make  a </p>
<p>simple Smarts roll to maintain his powers.</p>
<p>Arcane.Backgrounds</p>
<p>Below  are  the  five  different  types  of Arcane </p>
<p>Backgrounds.  Each  type  describes  the Arcane </p>
<p>Skill a character with that background uses, his </p>
<p>starting Power Points, the number of powers he </p>
<p>starts play with, and any potential drawbacks to </p>
<p>the power (such as Backlash or Malfunctions).</p>
<p>Arcane.Background.(Magic)</p>
<p><b>Arcane Skill:</b> Spellcasting (Smarts)</p>
<p><b>Starting Power Points: </b>10</p>
<p><b>Starting Powers:</b> 3</p>
<p>Magicians range from powerful wizards to vile </p>
<p>cultists. They draw on raw supernatural energy to </p>
<p>fuel their eldritch fires. This energy often infuses </p>
<p>the worlds in which they live, and is drawn forth </p>
<p>with elaborate rituals, words of power, runes, or </p>
<p>perhaps even dark sacrifices.</p>
<p>Wizards  are  often  quite  weak  early  in  their </p>
<p>careers, but are forces to be reckoned with as </p>
<p>they become powerful sorcerers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Backlash:</b>  When  a  wizard  rolls  a  1  on  his </p>
<p>Spellcasting die (regardless of his Wild Die), he </p>
<p>is automatically Shaken. This can cause a wound.</p>
<p>Arcane.Background.(Miracles)</p>
<p><b>Arcane Skill:</b> Faith (Spirit)</p>
<p><b>Starting Power Points:</b> 10</p>
<p><b>Starting Powers:</b> 2</p>
<p>Those who draw on miracles are priestly types </p>
<p>or  holy  champions. Their  power  comes  from  a </p>
<p>divine  presence  of  some  sort,  including  gods, </p>
<p>nature, or spirits. Their powers are usually invoked </p>
<p>with  a  few  words  of  prayer  or  by  performing </p>
<p>established rituals.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Protector:</b>  Those  who  cast  miracles  are </p>
<p>champions  of  their  particular  religions.  Good </p>
<p>priests vow to protect the innocent, fight evil, and </p>
<p>obey all other tenets of their particular religion. Evil </p>
<p>priests typically vow to defeat those who oppose </p>
<p>their religion, or simply to cause as much misery </p>
<p>and  strife  as  possible. The  player  and  Game </p>
<p>Master should come up with a simple list of what </p>
<p>is important to the character’s religion and use </p>
<p>this as a guide.</p>
<p>Champions  who  violate  their  beliefs  are </p>
<p>temporarily  or  permanently  forsaken  by  their </p>
<p>chosen deity. Minor sins give the character a –2 to </p>
<p>his Faith rolls for one week. Major sins rob him of </p>
<p>all arcane powers for one week. Mortal sins cause </p>
<p>the character to be forsaken until the penitent hero </p>
<p>completes some great quest or task of atonement </p>
<p>to regain his lost powers.</p>
<p>Arcane.Background.(Psionics)</p>
<p><b>Arcane Skill:</b> Psionics (Smarts)</p>
<p><b>Starting Power Points:</b> 10</p>
<p><b>Starting Powers:</b> 3</p>
<p>Psionicists  have  discovered  how  to  tap  into </p>
<p>their own psychic powers. They can manipulate </p>
<p>matter, create fire, or control their own bodies with </p>
<p>but a thought.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Brainburn:</b> When a psionic character rolls a </p>
<p>1 on his Psionics die (regardless of his Wild Die), </p>
<p>he is automatically Shaken. On a critical failure, </p>
<p>the psi lets out a psychic scream that causes him </p>
<p>to be Shaken along with all allies in a Large Burst </p>
<p>Template who fail a Spirit roll. This can cause a </p>
<p>wound.</p>
<p>Arcane.Background.(Super.Powers)</p>
<p><b>Arcane Skill: </b>Special (None)</p>
<p><b>Starting Power Points:</b> 20</p>
<p><b>Starting Powers:</b> 1</p>
<p>Characters with super powers gain their abilities </p>
<p>through  strange  circumstances,  such  as  being </p>
<p>bitten by irradiated creatures, exposure to strange </p>
<p>chemicals, or perhaps by finding alien artifacts. </p>
<p>This  particular  level  of  power  is  intended  for </p>
<p>relatively low-level “pulp” heroes. More powerful </p>
<p>super  types  are  dealt  with  in  specific  Savage </p>
<p>Settings, and you’ll find an alternate and far more </p>
<p>detailed system in our <i>Super Powers Companion.</i></p>
<p>Super powers work a little differently from most </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--120</p>
<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p>other Arcane Backgrounds—each power is its own </p>
<p>skill and has no linked attribute (and thus counts </p>
<p>as “lower” than its linked Attribute for purposes </p>
<p>of Advancement). A hero with the <i>armor</i> and <i>bolt </i></p>
<p>powers, for example, also has an Armor and a Bolt </p>
<p>skill he uses to enable it. It’s more expensive for </p>
<p>a character to improve his powers, but he starts </p>
<p>with more Power Points than other arcane types </p>
<p>so he can use his abilities more often.</p>
<p>Best of all, there are no drawbacks for super </p>
<p>powers as there are with other types of arcane </p>
<p>powers—the power either works or it doesn’t.</p>
<p>Arcane.Background.(Weird.Science)</p>
<p><b>Arcane  Skill: </b> Weird  Science  (Smarts—</p>
<p>see below)</p>
<p><b>Starting  Power  Points: </b> 10  (but  see </p>
<p>below)</p>
<p><b>Starting Powers:</b> 1</p>
<p>Weird Science is the creation of strange and </p>
<p>powerful devices. It differs from regular science </p>
<p>in that some element of the arcane is involved. </p>
<p>Maybe it’s just generic “super-science,” or perhaps </p>
<p>it’s divinely (or demonically) inspired. Maybe the </p>
<p>science  itself  is  relatively  sound,  but  it  derives </p>
<p>power from an arcane source, such as ghost rock </p>
<p>in <i>Deadlands</i>, or some other magical mineral or </p>
<p>essence in a steampunk fantasy game.</p>
<p>Weird  Science  is  different  in  that  each  new </p>
<p>power is actually a new “gizmo.” The player must </p>
<p>write down exactly what the device is when he </p>
<p>gains the power. An inventor with the <i>invisibility</i> </p>
<p>power,  for  instance,  actually  has  an <i> invisibility </i></p>
<p>belt, cloak, etc. Players are encouraged to give </p>
<p>their devices pseudo-scientific names as well (“Dr. </p>
<p>Zee’s Chromatic Disfibulating Device!”).</p>
<p>Weird Science is the skill an inventor uses when </p>
<p>activating most devices, and raises increase the </p>
<p>effects of the power as usual. If a device uses </p>
<p>a  different  skill,  such  as  Driving,  Fighting,  or </p>
<p>Shooting, the inventor uses  that  instead. A ray </p>
<p>gun, for example, uses the Shooting skill, while </p>
<p>a “vibroknife” (a knife with the <i>smite</i> power) uses </p>
<p>Fighting. </p>
<p>Powers that require an opposed roll, such as </p>
<p><i>puppet,</i>  also  use  the  scientist’s  Weird  Science </p>
<p>skill.</p>
<p>Each device comes with its own Power Points </p>
<p>equal to the inventor’s Power Points. An inventor </p>
<p>with  the <i> bolt</i>  power  and  10  Power  Points,  for </p>
<p>example, could make a ray gun that fires electrical </p>
<p>beams. The gun has 10 Power Points it can use </p>
<p>to fire the beams just like a wizard would cast the </p>
<p><i>bolt</i> spell.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Malfunction:</b>  Weird  science  devices  are </p>
<p>never  perfect  technology.  They  often  suffer </p>
<p>from  spectacular  and  deadly  malfunctions.  If  a </p>
<p>gadgeteer uses a device and rolls a 1 on the skill </p>
<p>die used to activate the gizmo, it has malfunctioned </p>
<p>in some way and does not work. Draw a card and </p>
<p>consult the Malfunction Table below:</p>
<p>Weird.Science.Malfunction.Table</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Clubs—Catastrophic  Malfunction:</b>  The </p>
<p>device explodes for 2d6 damage in a Large </p>
<p>Burst Template.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Hearts—Major  Malfunction:</b>  The  device </p>
<p>breaks  down. The  gadgeteer  may  not  use </p>
<p>it  again  until  it’s  repaired,  which  requires  a </p>
<p>Repair roll and 2d6 hours of work.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Diamonds—Minor Malfunction:</b> The device </p>
<p>suffers a minor hang-up. It can be fixed with </p>
<p>a Repair roll at –2.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Spades—Glitch:</b>  The  gizmo  activates  but </p>
<p>does  the  reverse  of  its  intent. An <i> invisibility</i> </p>
<p>belt makes the caster glow brightly, a weapon </p>
<p>fires at a random target, and so on. If a reverse </p>
<p>effect  makes  no  sense,  treat  it  as  a  Major </p>
<p>Malfunction instead.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>New  Powers:</b>  Each  time  a  Weird  Scientist </p>
<p>takes the New Power Edge, he has invented a </p>
<p>new  gadget.  He  simply  chooses  a  power  and </p>
<p>decides what kind of gizmo it’s contained in as </p>
<p>usual. He can also repeat a power he’s already </p>
<p>taken. A mad scientist might want to create two </p>
<p>ray-guns, for example, so that he can use one and </p>
<p>give one to a companion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Maintaining  Powers:</b>  Because  weird </p>
<p>scientists use inventions rather than cast spells, </p>
<p>they  don’t  suffer  any  penalties  for  maintaining </p>
<p>powers, but their devices still pay the maintenance </p>
<p>costs in Power Points as usual.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Recharging:</b>  Devices  regain  Power  Points </p>
<p>just like a character, at the rate of one point per </p>
<p>hour. Recharging may represent the device being </p>
<p>plugged into  an outlet, gathering  solar  rays, or </p>
<p>even fritzing out for a while until it miraculously </p>
<p>just  starts  working  again.  Regardless  of  the </p>
<p>description, however, it regains Power Points at </p>
<p>the rate of one per hour just like other power types.</p>
<p>The  Power  Edges  Rapid  Recharge  and </p>
<p>Improved  Rapid  Recharge  apply  to  all  of  the </p>
<p>inventor’s devices rather than the inventor himself. </p>
<p>More.on.Weird.Science</p>
<p>Weird Science is a little more complicated than </p>
<p>other Arcane Backgrounds and requires a bit more </p>
<p>explanation. First off, it’s important to understand </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--121</p>
<p>Powers</p>
<p>Weird  Science  isn’t  used  to  make  mundane </p>
<p>devices, even if they are extraordinary. As long as </p>
<p>they’re possible and aren’t too far above the given </p>
<p>tech level of the world, they’re just “high-tech.” </p>
<p>Only actual weird science, inspired by, created </p>
<p>by, or powered by some sort of supernatural force </p>
<p>qualifies.</p>
<p>It’s  also  important  to  remember  that  Weird </p>
<p>Science  doesn’t  allow  a  character  to </p>
<p>make anything he wants. He can </p>
<p>only make a device that utilizes </p>
<p>one of the powers in this book (or </p>
<p>an appropriate Savage Setting).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Sharing:</b> An  inventor  can </p>
<p>hand  his  device  over  to  a </p>
<p>companion  to  use.  The </p>
<p>device  works  the  same </p>
<p>for  the  companion  as  it </p>
<p>does  for  the  owner.  If  the </p>
<p>Weird Science skill is required, </p>
<p>the  companion  must  make </p>
<p>a </p>
<p>default  roll  as  usual. That  means </p>
<p>gizmos  are  typically  more  effective  when  used </p>
<p>by weird scientists than in the hands of others.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Soul Drain:</b> Weird Scientists cannot take the </p>
<p>Soul Drain Edge.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>More  Power  Points:</b>  When  an  inventor </p>
<p>gains  more  Power  Points,  he’s  assumed </p>
<p>to tinker with his existing devices and </p>
<p>upgrade  them  as  well. This  means </p>
<p><i>all</i> of his devices gain the additional </p>
<p>Power  Points.  In  effect,  if  an </p>
<p>inventor  has  20  Power  Points, </p>
<p>each  of  his  devices  have  20 </p>
<p>Power Points as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Losing  Devices:</b>  If  an </p>
<p>inventor’s  gizmo  is  taken  away, </p>
<p>lost,  or  destroyed,  he  can  make </p>
<p>another in 2d6 hours as long as he has </p>
<p>access to a workshop and some basic </p>
<p>components. This  requires  a  Repair  roll. A </p>
<p>raise halves the time needed to create the device.</p>
<p>If the original should somehow be returned, it </p>
<p>no longer functions (the character doesn’t get a </p>
<p>“free” duplicate in this way).</p>
<p><i><b>Example:</b> Doctor Gold starts play with a </i></p>
<p><i>vibroknife (a knife with the </i>smite<i> power) and </i></p>
<p><i>10 Power Points. Later on, he levels up and </i></p>
<p><i>chooses the New Power Edge. With that he </i></p>
<p><i>invents a ray-gun with the </i>bolt<i> power. Both </i></p>
<p><i>devices have 10 Power Points.</i></p>
<p><i>In a fight, Doctor Gold first “turns on” his </i></p>
<p><i>vibroknife by making a Weird Science roll. He </i></p>
<p><i>gets a raise so the knife does +4 damage for </i></p>
<p><i>its duration. The ray-gun doesn’t have to be </i></p>
<p><i>activated. The Doc simply makes a Shooting </i></p>
<p><i>roll  whenever  he  fires  it  (just  like  a  mage </i></p>
<p><i>would make a Spellcasting roll).</i></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--122</p>
<p>Trappings.&amp;.Effects</p>
<p>Trappings are the heart and soul of the powers </p>
<p>system.  With  just  a  few  simple  twists,  a <i> bolt</i> </p>
<p>power can represent rays of ice, streaks of light, </p>
<p>or swarms of stinging bees.</p>
<p>The powers themselves are designed to be as </p>
<p>simple to use and remember as possible. This </p>
<p>helps the Game Master remember what all the </p>
<p>powers  do,  and  helps  players  remember  the </p>
<p>rules for common powers even between different </p>
<p>settings. But just because these powers work the </p>
<p>same from setting to setting doesn’t mean they </p>
<p>have  to  look  the  same,  have  the  same  names </p>
<p>(to  the  characters  in  that  world),  or  even  have </p>
<p>the <i>exact</i> same effects—that’s where Trappings </p>
<p>come in. </p>
<p>For the most part, Trappings should be merely </p>
<p>cosmetic. But sometimes it makes sense for there </p>
<p>to be additional effects. A heat ray should have a </p>
<p>chance of catching combustible objects on fire, for </p>
<p>example, and an electric blast should do slightly </p>
<p>more damage to targets in full metal armor.</p>
<p>Below  are  examples  of  effects  players  and </p>
<p>Game Masters can use for common Trappings.</p>
<p>Acid</p>
<p>Acid is most commonly an attack Trapping, but </p>
<p>could  be  used  defensively  against  those  who </p>
<p>touch  it  (such  as <i> armor</i>  that  corrodes  anyone </p>
<p>who touches it).</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Corrosion:</b>  If  the  subject  with  an  acidic </p>
<p>Trapping  is  touched  the  victim  must  make </p>
<p>a Vigor roll or suffer Fatigue (the equivalent </p>
<p>of  Bumps  and  Bruises).  If  the  ability  is  a </p>
<p>damaging attack that results in a Shaken or </p>
<p>higher result, roll a d6. On a 6, any material </p>
<p>the acid hit is ruined (armor loses a point of </p>
<p>protection instead).</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Burn:</b> A  power  that  does  fixed  damage </p>
<p>reduces  its  die  type  by  one,  but  does  one </p>
<p>less  die  of  damage  on  the  caster’s  next </p>
<p>action  unless  counteracted  in  some  way </p>
<p>(taking an action to wash it off or stripping off </p>
<p>the acid-covered item). For instance, a 2 PP </p>
<p>acid <i>bolt</i> causes 3d4 when it hits and 2d4 on </p>
<p>the caster’s action as well (unless the target </p>
<p>neutralizes it with liquid).</p>
<p>Cold/Ice</p>
<p>Cold and ice cause freezing effects, and can be </p>
<p>both positive and negative.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Armor:</b> Beneficial powers provide +2 Armor </p>
<p>versus cold, ice, fire, and heat, but fire and </p>
<p>heat attacks count as a <i>dispel</i> against them.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Fatigue:</b> Harmful powers require a Vigor roll </p>
<p>(at –2 on a raise) to avoid cold-based Fatigue, </p>
<p>but the power’s range is reduced to half (non-</p>
<p>ranged powers have their Power Point cost </p>
<p>doubled).</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Skate:</b> A success on a beneficial power (like </p>
<p><i>armor</i>) results in ice not counting as Difficult </p>
<p>Ground as ice spikes or skates form on the </p>
<p>target’s feet.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Slow:</b> A raise with a detrimental power (like </p>
<p><i>stun</i>) results in the target’s movement counting </p>
<p>as Difficult Ground while the power is active </p>
<p>(or his next movement for Instant powers) due </p>
<p>to the slick ice frozen on him.</p>
<p>Darkness</p>
<p>Darkness is frequently tied to another trapping </p>
<p>such  as  cold  or  necromantic,  so  those  options </p>
<p>can apply as well.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Darkening:</b> Targets suffer a penalty to oppose </p>
<p>the  power  equal  to  the  current  darkness </p>
<p>penalty. The  caster  suffers  a  –2  penalty  in </p>
<p>normal  light,  and  the <i> light</i>  power  works  as </p>
<p><i>dispel</i> against the power.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Shroud:</b> The target is momentarily shrouded </p>
<p>in  tendrils  of  darkness. Targets  of  negative </p>
<p>powers suffer a –1 penalty to all vision-based </p>
<p>trait rolls while the power is active or on their </p>
<p>next action for Instant powers. Positive effects </p>
<p>slightly obscure the character, making him –1 </p>
<p>to be hit by ranged attacks.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Stealth:</b>  For  beneficial  powers,  adding  +1 </p>
<p>Power Point to the cost causes the darkness </p>
<p>to cling to the target and increases Stealth by </p>
<p>one die type, or two on a raise.</p>
<p>Electricity</p>
<p>Electricity  has  a  strong  impact  on  the  body’s </p>
<p>nervous and muscular systems.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Armor Piercing:</b> The electricity arcs to a foe’s </p>
<p>exposed areas, ignoring some armor (AP 2) </p>
<p>at a cost of +1 Power Point. </p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Conduction:</b>  Damaging  powers  reduce </p>
<p>damage by one die type, but add an additional </p>
<p>die  of  damage  to  targets  in  the  following </p>
<p>situations: carrying more than 10 pounds of </p>
<p>conductive metal, contacting a source of water, </p>
<p>or otherwise touching an electrical conductor </p>
<p>of some kind. For instance, an electrical <i>blast</i> </p>
<p>at  maximum  effect  does  3d4  damage  in  a </p>
<p>Large Burst Template, but if the targets are </p>
<p>standing in water, they take 4d4 damage.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Jazz:</b> Beneficial powers “jazz” the target. They </p>
<p>cost +1 Power Point to cast, but on a success </p>
<p>add +2 to Pace and on a raise increase Agility </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--123</p>
<p>Powers</p>
<p>one die type for the duration of the power.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Jolt:</b> Helpful powers shock a target out of their </p>
<p>distraction on a raise, providing an immediate </p>
<p>free roll to recover from being Shaken.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Spasms:</b>  Harmful  powers  cause  temporary </p>
<p>muscle  contraction  if  cast  with  a  raise;  the </p>
<p>target  has  to  make  a  Vigor  roll  or  be  at  –2 </p>
<p>Parry until his next action.</p>
<p>Fire/Heat</p>
<p>Fire is a very common trapping for attack powers </p>
<p>with  heat  having  similar  but  less  combustible </p>
<p>effects.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Armor Piercing:</b> Fire and heat bypass cracks </p>
<p>in armor. A damaging power gains AP 2 by </p>
<p>increasing the base cost by +1 Power Point. </p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Aura:</b> Beneficial powers surround a subject </p>
<p>with a hot or fiery aura, and as a replacement </p>
<p>for their normal benefit on a raise, the target </p>
<p>gains the effect of the <i>damage field</i> power that </p>
<p>causes 2d4 damage.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Fatigue:</b> A heat trapping on an attack forces </p>
<p>the victim to make a Vigor roll or suffer Fatigue.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Flammable:</b> With a hit by a fire power, roll for </p>
<p>any potentially flammable objects to catch fire </p>
<p>(see page 101). For a heat trapping, liquids on </p>
<p>the target (water, potions, etc.) evaporate on a </p>
<p>6 on a d6 with a success or a 4–6 on a raise.</p>
<p>Light</p>
<p>Light typically represents goodness, sunshine, </p>
<p>or holiness.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Beam:</b>  Light-based  damaging  attacks  are </p>
<p>like a focused laser, providing armor piercing </p>
<p>capability.  Reduce  the  damage  by  one  die </p>
<p>type, but add AP 4 to the effect.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Enhance:</b> This  trapping  applies  directly  to </p>
<p>the <i>light</i> power. Reduce it to a Medium Burst </p>
<p>Template and extend the duration to 1 hour (1/</p>
<p>hour) or give it a range of Smarts x 2 affecting </p>
<p>animate  targets  as  well  (an  unwilling  target </p>
<p>gets an opposed Agility roll to avoid). Reduce </p>
<p><i>light</i>  to  a  Small  Burst Template  and  give  it </p>
<p>both abilities. </p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Glow:</b>  Subjects  affected  with  a  raise  glow </p>
<p>for  the  duration,  creating  light  in  a  Small </p>
<p>Burst Template centered on them. This can </p>
<p>give them light, but also make them targets. </p>
<p>An  Instant  power  with  that  effect  allows  a </p>
<p>character on Hold or with the Joker to make </p>
<p>an attack for the split second the subject is </p>
<p>illuminated (avoiding any darkness penalties </p>
<p>to  hit  them).  The  character  must  take  his </p>
<p>action immediately after the caster’s turn to </p>
<p>gain the benefit.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Sunlight:</b> In a setting with vampires and other </p>
<p>such creatures, <i>light</i> is equivalent to natural </p>
<p>sunlight.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--124</p>
<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p>Necromantic</p>
<p>Necromantic trappings may involve a “negative </p>
<p>energy” opposed to life or symbols of death like </p>
<p>bones and skulls.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Fear:</b>  All  Undead  (depending  on  their </p>
<p>prevalence) are considered to have a level of </p>
<p>Arcane Resistance versus the power, and the </p>
<p>living must make Fear checks when hit with it.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Feign Undeath:</b> A raise on the roll provides a </p>
<p>–1 to be hit by Undead as they see the subject </p>
<p>as one of their own.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Shards:</b> Ranged attacks splinter on impact, </p>
<p>creating shrapnel that does +1 damage versus </p>
<p>unarmored targets but –1 damage versus foes </p>
<p>with Armor.</p>
<p>Sound</p>
<p>Sound is a common trapping for sonic or music-</p>
<p>based spellcasters. Sound-based powers should </p>
<p>never work in a vacuum!</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Absorbtion:</b>  Beneficial  powers  absorb  the </p>
<p>subject’s  sound,  so  Stealth  is  increased  a </p>
<p>die  type,  but  they  have  to  yell  to  be  heard </p>
<p>normally  and  speaking  becomes  a  normal </p>
<p>action instead of a free one.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Aquatic Boom:</b> Sound travels better in water </p>
<p>than  in  air.  Underwater,  an  attack  power </p>
<p>causes +2 damage. In air, however, it causes </p>
<p>–2 damage.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Deafen:</b> A raise with the power (or a Shaken </p>
<p>or better from damage) results in a –2 penalty </p>
<p>to  hearing-based  Notice  rolls  for  the  target </p>
<p>until  the  power  ends  or  they  recover  from </p>
<p>being Shaken.</p>
<p>Design.Note.-.The.Power.of.Names</p>
<p><i>What really makes powers stand out in a </i></p>
<p><i>setting are their names, particularly if they’re </i></p>
<p><i>spells  or  miracles.  Nickodemus’  Necrotic </i></p>
<p><i>Surge sounds  much more frightening  than </i></p>
<p><i>bolt.</i></p>
<p><i>It’s  important  for  official </i> Savage  Worlds </p>
<p><i>books to use the simpler nomenclature for </i></p>
<p><i>ease  of  reference.  We  don’t  want  you  to </i></p>
<p><i>have to look up every power listed under a </i></p>
<p><i>spellcaster’s repertoire after you’ve become </i></p>
<p><i>familiar with the standard powers. You should </i></p>
<p><i>encourage  your  players,  however,  to  use </i></p>
<p><i>more descriptive names.</i></p>
<p><i>If the group in a modern-day horror game </i></p>
<p><i>finds a scroll of </i>armor<i>, that’s probably much </i></p>
<p><i>more rare and exciting than it would be </i></p>
<p><i>in a fantasy game. Give it a name like </i></p>
<p><i>Blessing of the Faithful and then tell </i></p>
<p><i>them  it  works  “just  like  the </i> armor<i> </i></p>
<p><i>spell.” They’ll get the idea and the </i></p>
<p><i>extremely  functional  and  flexible  powers </i></p>
<p><i>system will convey much more flavor and </i></p>
<p><i>excitement.</i></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--125</p>
<p>Powers</p>
<p>Listed below are a number of powers available </p>
<p>in  most  Savage  Settings.  Each  power  has  the </p>
<p>following statistics:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Rank:</b> This is the Rank a character must be </p>
<p>in order to learn this power: Novice, Seasoned, </p>
<p>Veteran, Heroic, or Legendary.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Power Points:</b> The number of points it costs to </p>
<p>use the power. Some powers allow the character </p>
<p>to pay additional points for additional effects. This </p>
<p>is always determined—and paid for—before the </p>
<p>dice are rolled.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Range: </b>The maximum distance the target of </p>
<p>the power can be from the user when the power is </p>
<p>first activated (it remains in effect even if the target </p>
<p>moves out of Range as long as it’s maintained). </p>
<p>A Range of Smarts, for example, means 10” for </p>
<p>a character with a Smarts of d10. If a power lists </p>
<p>three Ranges, such as 12/24/48, these are read </p>
<p>just  like  missile  weapon  Ranges,  and  subtract </p>
<p>the standard penalties for each Range bracket </p>
<p>(0/–2/–4). The arcane character’s skill roll acts as </p>
<p>both his “casting” and attack total for these type </p>
<p>powers (Weird Scientists use Fighting or Shooting </p>
<p>as usual instead).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Duration: </b>How long the power lasts in rounds. </p>
<p>A power with a Duration of 1 lasts until the heroes’ </p>
<p>next action. A Duration of 2 means it lasts for two </p>
<p>actions, and so on.</p>
<p>If the Duration of a power has a second entry </p>
<p>in parentheses, such as 3 (1/round), it means the </p>
<p>power has a Duration of 3 rounds and may then </p>
<p>be maintained from round to round by spending </p>
<p>the listed number of Power Points (1 in this case). </p>
<p>Each power maintained subtracts 1 from future </p>
<p>uses of the hero’s arcane skill.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Trappings:</b>  Listed  here  are  some  ideas  for </p>
<p>what the power might look like in different types </p>
<p>of settings. In a science fiction game, <i>armor</i> might </p>
<p>represent the psyker’s telekinetic force pushing </p>
<p>attacks away from him. The same power used by </p>
<p>a superhero might be a force field, or a body of </p>
<p>flame that melts incoming projectiles.</p>
<p><i><b>Example:</b>  Greywald  the  Melodious  is  a </i></p>
<p><i>bard in a high-fantasy setting. In battle, he </i></p>
<p><i>strums his lyre or sings songs to enable his </i></p>
<p><i>powers.</i></p>
<p><i>His </i>burst<i> is a sonic cone that rattles nerves </i></p>
<p><i>and shatters eardrums. He calls this one “The </i></p>
<p><i>Battle Cry of Evanier.” Greywald’s </i>slumber is<i> </i></p>
<p><i>“Lullaby of the Fallen,” a sad mournful tune </i></p>
<p><i>that puts his enemies to sleep even in the </i></p>
<p><i>heat of battle.</i></p>
<p><i>Greywald’s player has decided for himself </i></p>
<p><i>that  he  won’t  take  powers  that  don’t  work </i></p>
<p><i>well within his theme—such as </i>disguise<i> or </i></p>
<p>elemental manipulation.</p>
<p>Armor</p>
<p><b>Rank:</b> Novice</p>
<p><b>Power Points:</b> 2</p>
<p><b>Range:</b> Touch</p>
<p><b>Duration: </b>3 (1/round)</p>
<p><b>Trappings:</b> A  mystical  glow,  hardened  skin, </p>
<p>ethereal armor, a mass of insects or worms.</p>
<p><i>Armor</i>  creates  a  field  of  magical  protection </p>
<p>around a character or an actual shell of some sort, </p>
<p>effectively giving the target Armor. Success grants </p>
<p>the recipient 2 points of Armor. A raise grants 4 </p>
<p>points of Armor.</p>
<p>Whether  the <i> armor</i>  is  visible  or  not  depends </p>
<p>largely on the trapping.</p>
<p>Banish</p>
<p><b>Rank:</b> Veteran</p>
<p><b>Power Points:</b> 3</p>
<p><b>Range:</b> Smarts</p>
<p><b>Duration: </b>Instant</p>
<p><b>Trappings:</b> Holy items, arcane symbols, handful </p>
<p>of salt.</p>
<p>Whether ghosts, elementals, or demons, <i>banish</i> </p>
<p>removes  them  all.  This  power  can  affect  any </p>
<p>creature that is not native to the current plane of </p>
<p>existence (GM’s determination).</p>
<p>This  spell  is  an  opposed  roll  of  the  caster’s </p>
<p>arcane  skill  versus  the  target’s  Spirit.  On  a </p>
<p>success, the target is Shaken. On a raise, it is </p>
<p>sent to its proper plane of existence.</p>
<p>If  the  target  is  a  Wild  Card,  each  casting  of </p>
<p><i>banish</i>  causes  a  wound  instead.  If  the  target </p>
<p>already has three wounds, it is then banished to </p>
<p>its native plane—but it is not slain.</p>
<p>Barrier</p>
<p><b>Rank:</b> Seasoned</p>
<p><b>Power Points:</b> 1/section</p>
<p><b>Range:</b> Smarts</p>
<p><b>Duration:</b> 3 (1 per section, per round)</p>
<p><b>Trappings:</b> Fire, ice, thorns, force, bones.</p>
<p><i>Barrier</i> creates a solid, immobile wall to protect </p>
<p>the user against attack or to entrap an opponent.</p>
<p>Regardless of what the <i>barrier</i> is made of (ice, </p>
<p>thorns, stone, energy, etc.), it has a Toughness </p>
<p>of 10. Every Power Point spent creates a 1” wide </p>
<p>section of wall. The <i>barrier</i> ranges in thickness </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--126</p>
<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p>from a few “real world” inches for stone or other </p>
<p>hard materials up to a foot for things like bones </p>
<p>or ice. (If you’re using a gridded mat to play, draw </p>
<p>the <i>barrier</i> between the squares directly along the </p>
<p>grid-lines.) The exact placement of each section </p>
<p>is defined by the caster, but each section must </p>
<p>be connected to at least one other section after </p>
<p>the first.</p>
<p>When the spell expires or a section is broken, </p>
<p>it crumbles to dust or dissipates. Trappings are </p>
<p>never left behind.</p>
<p>Each section of the <i>barrier</i> may be destroyed by </p>
<p>an attack that equals its Toughness of 10. Physical </p>
<p>walls are treated exactly like inanimate objects; </p>
<p>they are considered to have a Parry of 2 (ranged </p>
<p>attacks work as normal), but raises on the attack </p>
<p>roll do not grant bonus damage nor do damage </p>
<p>dice Ace. Opponents may climb the <i>barrier</i> at –2 to </p>
<p>their Climbing roll if it is made of something solid. </p>
<p>Fiery versions of the barrier cause 2d4 damage </p>
<p>to anyone who wishes to leap through instead.</p>

<p><b>Rank:</b> Novice</p>
<p><b>Power Points:</b> Special</p>
<p><b>Range:</b> Smarts x 100 yards</p>
<p><b>Duration: </b>10 minutes</p>
<p><b>Trappings:</b> The mage concentrates and gestures </p>
<p>with his hands.</p>
<p>This  spell  allows  mages  to  speak  with  and </p>
<p>guide  the  actions  of  nature’s  beasts.  It  works </p>
<p>only  on  creatures  with  animal  intelligence,  not </p>
<p>humanoids. Nor does it work on conjured, magical, </p>
<p>or otherwise “unnatural” animals.</p>
<p>The  target  must  be  within  the  sorcerer’s </p>
<p>range — it is not conjured.</p>
<p>The cost to control a creature depends on its </p>
<p>Size. The base cost is 3, plus twice its Size for </p>
<p>creatures with a Size greater than 0. A great white </p>
<p>shark (Size +4) costs 3 plus 8 (2x4), or 11 points. </p>
<p>A roc (Size +8) costs 19 Power Points to control.</p>
<p>Swarms may also be controlled. Small swarms </p>
<p>cost 3, Mediums 5, and Large 8. Thus a single </p>
<p>rat costs 3 to control, as does a small swarm of </p>
<p>the creatures.</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Instant</p>
<p><b>Trappings:</b>  Balls  of  fire,  ice,  light,  darkness, </p>
<p>colored bolts, swarm of insects.</p>
<p><i>Blast</i> is an area effect power that can put down </p>
<p>many opponents at once. The caster first picks </p>
<p>where he wants to center the <i>blast</i>, then makes </p>
<p>the  appropriate  skill  roll.  Normal  ranged  attack </p>
<p>modifiers apply.</p>
<p>The area of effect is a Medium Burst Template. If </p>
<p>the roll is failed, the <i>blast</i> deviates as a launched </p>
<p>projectile.</p>
<p>Targets within the blast suffer 2d6 damage. <i>Blast </i></p>
<p>counts as a Heavy Weapon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Additional  Effects:</b>  For  double  the  Power </p>
<p>Points, the blast does 3d6 damage, <i>or</i> the size </p>
<p>is increased to a Large Burst Template. For triple </p>
<p>the points, it does both.</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Instant</p>
<p><b>Trappings:</b>  Bright  flash  of  light,  sand  in  eyes, </p>
<p>sticky shadows.</p>
<p>This power temporarily blinds a target or targets. </p>
<p>Those affected must make an Agility roll at –2 to </p>
<p>avert their gaze and avoid the effect (at –4 if the </p>
<p>caster got a raise on the attack roll). On a failure, </p>
<p>victims  are  Shaken  and  –2  to  Parry  until  their </p>
<p>next action. If the target rolls a 1 on his Agility die </p>
<p>(regardless of the Wild Die), he’s Shaken and fully </p>
<p>blind until he recovers from being Shaken. Blinded </p>
<p>victims suffer a –6 penalty to all Trait rolls that </p>
<p>require vision and have their Parry reduced to 2.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Additional Effects:</b> For 2 Power Points, the </p>
<p>power affects a single target. For 4 Power Points, </p>
<p>the  power  affects  everyone  in  a  Medium  Burst </p>
<p>Template. For 6 points, it affects everyone in a </p>
<p>Large Burst Template.</p>
<p>Bolt</p>
<p><b>Rank:</b> Novice</p>
<p><b>Power Points:</b> 1 per missile</p>

<p><i>Bolt </i>is a standard attack power of wizards, and </p>
<p>can also be used for ray guns, bursts of energy, </p>
<p>streaks of holy light, and other ranged attacks. </p>
<p>The damage of the <i>bolt </i>is 2d6.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Additional  Bolts: </b> The  character  may  cast </p>
<p>up to 3 <i>bolts </i>by spending a like amount of Power </p>
<p>Points. The <i>bolts </i>may be spread among targets </p>
<p>as the character chooses. This is rolled just like </p>
<p>fully-automatic weapons fire but without the full-</p>
<p>auto penalty—the character rolls a spellcasting </p>
<p>die for each <i>bolt</i> and compares each to the Target </p>
<p>Number separately. If the caster is a Wild Card, </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--127</p>
<p>Powers</p>
<p>he also rolls a Wild Die, which may replace any </p>
<p>of the casting dice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Additional Damage: </b>The caster may instead </p>
<p>cast a single 3d6 <i>bolt</i> for 2 Power Points. He may </p>
<p>not cast multiple <i>bolts</i> when using this ability.</p>

<p><b>Duration: </b>3 (1/round)</p>
<p><b>Trappings:</b>  Physical  change,  glowing  aura, </p>
<p>potions.</p>
<p>This power allows a character to increase any </p>
<p>of a target’s Traits by one die type for a standard </p>
<p>success, or by two with a raise. The affected Trait </p>
<p>can exceed d12. Each step over d12 adds +1 to </p>
<p>his Trait total. For example, a raise on someone </p>
<p>who already has a d12 in the affected Trait grants </p>
<p>him d12+2 for the duration of the power.</p>
<p>The  power  can  also  be  used  to  lower  an </p>
<p>opponent’s Trait. This is an opposed roll against </p>
<p>the victim’s Spirit. Success lowers any Trait of the </p>
<p>caster’s choice one step, a raise lowers it two </p>
<p>steps. A Trait cannot be lowered below a d4. </p>
<p>Multiple  castings  stack,  though  the  caster </p>
<p>must  keep  track  of  when  each  casting </p>
<p>expires as usual.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Additional  Targets:</b>  The  power  may </p>
<p>affect  an  additional  target  for  every  additional </p>
<p>Power  Point  spent,  up  to  a  maximum  of  five </p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> 3 (2/round)</p>
<p><b>Trappings:</b>  Dissolving  into  the  earth  and </p>

<p><i>Burrow</i> allows a mage standing on raw earth </p>
<p>to meld into it. He can remain underground if he </p>
<p>wants in a sort of “limbo” or <i>burrow</i> to anywhere </p>
<p>with a Pace equal to the power’s Range. A mage </p>
<p>with a Smarts of d8 could therefore move up to </p>
<p>16” (32 yards) on the first round, then maintain </p>
<p>the spell and stay submerged for the second and </p>
<p>move another 16”.</p>
<p>A <i>burrowing</i> earth mage can attempt to surprise </p>
<p>a foe (even one who saw him <i>burrow</i>) by making </p>
<p>an opposed Stealth versus Notice roll. If the mage </p>
<p>wins,  he  gains  +2  to  attack  and  damage  that </p>
<p>round, or +4 with a raise. Targets on Hold may </p>
<p>attempt to interrupt the attack as usual.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>

<p>--Page--128</p>
<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p>When  cast,  place  the  thin  end  of  the  Cone </p>
<p>Template at the character’s front. Targets within </p>
<p>the  template  may  make Agility  rolls  versus  the </p>
<p>caster’s arcane skill roll to avoid the blaze. Those </p>
<p>who fail suffer 2d10 damage. This counts as a </p>
<p>Heavy Weapon.</p>

<p><b>Trappings:</b> Hypnotic lights, brief illusions, loud </p>
<p>noises.</p>
<p>Instilling confusion in enemies is a powerful aid </p>
<p>in combat, and this power provides that ability. </p>
<p>On a success, a target must make a Smarts roll </p>
<p>at –2 or be Shaken, and on a raise, the roll is </p>
<p>made at –4.</p>

<p><b>Rank:</b> Seasoned</p>
<p><b>Power Points:</b> 4</p>
<p><b>Range:</b> Touch</p>
<p><b>Duration:</b> 3 (2/round)</p>
<p><b>Trappings:</b> Fiery aura, spikes, electrical field.</p>
<p><i>Damage  field</i>  creates  an  effect  around  a </p>
<p>character  that  deals  damage  to  anyone  who </p>
<p>contacts  them  in  close  combat.  The  damage </p>
<p>affects  any  adjacent  character  who  makes  a </p>
<p>successful attack roll against the subject. It has </p>
<p>no effect on non-adjacent attackers (for example, </p>
<p>Reach or ranged attacks).</p>
<p>If  a  character  with  a <i> damage  field</i>  strikes </p>
<p>someone in unarmed combat, the target takes the </p>
<p>field’s damage plus the character’s Strength die </p>
<p>(Str+2d6). The character may also simply touch </p>
<p>the opponent (+2 to Fighting) and do the field’s </p>
<p>damage  only. A  target  who  is  grappled  suffers </p>
<p>the field’s damage each round on the attacker’s </p>
<p>action;  if  the  attacker  chooses  on  following </p>
<p>rounds  to  actively  damage  the  target,  he  adds </p>
<p>his Strength die to the damage roll as above and </p>
<p>may get a bonus die for a raise.</p>
<p>With a success, the power does 2d6 damage. </p>
<p>With a raise, <i>damage field</i> causes 2d8 damage.</p>
<p>Darksight</p>
<p><b>Rank:</b> Novice</p>
<p><b>Power Points:</b> 1</p>
<p><b>Range:</b> Touch</p>
<p><b>Duration:</b> 1 hour (1/hour)</p>
<p><b>Trappings:</b> Glowing eyes, dilated pupils, sonic </p>
<p>sight.</p>
<p>Whereas <i>light</i> creates a source of illumination </p>
<p>usable by others, <i>darksight</i> affects only a single </p>
<p>person and can be much more clandestine.</p>
<p>On a success, this spell halves any darkness </p>
<p>penalty for the subject (round down). For example, </p>
<p>a character in Dim (–1) lighting would suffer no </p>
<p>penalty,  and  one  in Pitch  Darkness  (–4)  would </p>
<p>only suffer a –2. On a raise, the spell negates </p>
<p>all darkness penalties up to the maximum of –6.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>

<p><b>Rank:</b> Novice</p>
<p><b>Power Points:</b> 2</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> 3 (1/round)</p>
<p><b>Trappings:</b> Mystical shield, gust of wind, phantom </p>
<p>servant that intercepts the missiles.</p>
<p><i>Deflection</i>  powers  work  in  a  variety  of  ways. </p>
<p>Some  actually  deflect  incoming  attacks,  others </p>
<p>blur the target’s form or produce other illusionary </p>
<p>effects.  The  end  result  is  always  the  same </p>
<p>however — to  misdirect  incoming  melee  and </p>
<p>missile attacks from the user. </p>
<p>With  a  standard  success,  attackers  must </p>
<p>subtract 2 from any Fighting, Shooting, or other </p>
<p>attack rolls directed at the user. A raise increases </p>
<p>the penalty to –4. This also acts as Armor against </p>
<p>area effect weapons.</p>
<p>Detect/Conceal.Arcana</p>
<p><b>Rank:</b> Novice</p>
<p><b>Power Points:</b> 2</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> 3 (1/round) or 1 hour (1/hour)</p>
<p><b>Trappings:</b> Waving hands, whispered words.</p>
<p><i>Detect/conceal  arcana</i>  allows  a  character </p>
<p>to  sense  supernatural  persons,  objects,  or </p>
<p>effects within sight. This includes invisible foes, </p>
<p>enchantments on people or items, mad science </p>
<p>devices, and so on.</p>
<p>The power can also be reversed to conceal a </p>
<p>single supernatural item, being, or effect. This has </p>
<p>the same cost, but the duration is much longer — 1 </p>
<p>hour with a maintenance cost of 1 per hour. When </p>
<p>used in this way, those who wish to see through </p>
<p>the ruse with <i>detect arcana</i> use their arcane skill </p>
<p>roll  as  an  opposed  roll  against  the  concealer’s </p>
<p>skill (rolled anew each time <i>detect arcana</i> is cast). </p>
<p>The detecting character may only attempt to see </p>

<p><b>Trappings:</b>  Malleable  features,  illusionary </p>
<p>appearance, hair of new form.</p>
<p><i>Disguise</i>  allows  the  character  to  assume  the </p>

<p>person. The base cost is 3 Power Points, plus </p>
<p>1 point per level of Size difference between the </p>
<p>character and the person she is impersonating. </p>
<p>The  character  cannot  emulate  someone  more </p>
<p>than 2 Size levels different from themselves. It </p>
<p>requires a Notice roll at –2 to see through <i>disguise</i> </p>
<p>if  someone  is  familiar  with  the  specific  person </p>
<p>mimicked;  the  penalty  increases  to  –4  with  a </p>

<p><b>Trappings:</b> Waving hands, whispered words.</p>
<p><i>Dispel</i> allows a hero to negate enemy spells, </p>
<p>miracles, mad science, or super powers. It has </p>
<p>no effect on innate powers, such as a dragon’s </p>
<p>breath or a banshee’s scream. Neither does <i>dispel</i> </p>
<p>work on magic items or permanent enchantments </p>
<p>unless  the  specific  item  or  enchantment  says </p>
<p>otherwise.</p>
<p><i>Dispel</i> can be used on a power already in effect </p>
<p>or to counter an enemy power as it’s being used. </p>
<p>The latter requires the countering mage to be on </p>
<p>Hold and interrupt his foe’s action as usual.</p>
<p>In either case, <i>dispelling</i> the opponent’s power </p>
<p>is an opposed roll of arcane skills. The <i>dispelling</i> </p>
<p>character  suffers  a  –2  modifier  if  the  target </p>
<p>power  is  of  another  type  (magic  vs.  miracles, </p>
<p>superpowers vs. mad science, etc).</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> 1 minute</p>
<p><b>Trappings:</b> Contact spirits of dead, commune with </p>
<p>deity, demonic interrogation.</p>
<p>This  power  allows  the  caster  to  contact  an </p>
<p>otherworldly being to gain information. Due to the </p>
<p>extraplanar nature of this power, it is very draining </p>
<p>to the caster.</p>
<p>On a success, the caster may ask one question </p>
<p>that can be answered by “Yes,” “No,” or “Possibly” </p>
<p>(if there is no absolute answer). On a raise, the </p>
<p>question may be answered in five words or less </p>
<p>(the GM may allow a longer, more detailed answer </p>
<p>in cryptic form).</p>
<p>The spell’s duration is one minute, during which </p>
<p>the caster may take no other actions or movement. </p>
<p>If the caster is Shaken during that time, he must </p>
<p>make a Smarts roll or the power is disrupted.</p>
<p>If the question relates to a living being (including </p>
<p>beings who may “live” by mystical means such </p>
<p>as  undead,  constructs,  elementals,  etc.),  then </p>
<p>the  arcane  skill  roll  is  opposed  by  their  Spirit. </p>
<p><i>Divination</i>  is  also  opposed  by <i> conceal  arcana</i>. </p>
<p>In  the  case  of <i> conceal  arcana</i>  on  a  being,  the </p>

<p><b>Trappings:</b> Prayer, whispered words, gestures.</p>
<p>This  spell  removes  a  spellcaster’s  source  of </p>
<p>power, limiting his ability to cast magic.</p>
<p>The  caster  picks  a  single  target  within  range </p>
<p>and  makes  an  opposed  arcane  skill  roll.  The </p>
<p>caster suffers a –2 modifier if the target power is </p>
<p>of another type (magic vs. miracles, superpowers </p>
<p>vs. mad science, for example).</p>
<p>With a success, he drains 1d6+1 Power Points </p>
<p>from the victim. On a raise, the victim loses 1d8+2 </p>
<p>Power Points. These rolls don’t Ace. Targets with </p>
<p>Arcane  Background:  Weird  Science  lose  the </p>
<p>Power Points from all “gizmos” on their person </p>
<p>equally.</p>
<p>The victim cannot be reduced below zero Power </p>
<p>Points. Drained Power Points are not taken by the </p>

<p><b>Trappings:</b> A few simple gestures.</p>
<p>A  character  who  chooses  this  power  can </p>
<p>perform basic “tricks” using the four elements: air, </p>
<p>earth, fire, and water (these elements may vary </p>
<p>depending on the setting). The GM is the final </p>
<p>arbiter on what effects can be performed (nothing </p>
<p>that mimics another power), but some examples </p>
<p>are listed below.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Air:</b> The caster can create lesser air currents </p>
<p>to blow out a candle, fan a flame, lift a skirt, or </p>
<p>cool his body in oppressive heat (+1 to a single </p>
<p>Fatigue roll caused by heat).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Earth:</b> A wave of the hand can open a one-foot </p>
<p>square hole in soft earth (or half that in stone), </p>
<p>or  cause  a  spray  of  sand  that  might  blind  an </p>
<p>opponent (+1 to a Trick roll).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Fire:</b> The caster can snap his fingers to create </p>
<p>a small flame (about the size of a hot match). With </p>
<p>existing fire, he can urge it to spread (+1 to see if a </p>
<p>fire spreads), cause it to flare (perhaps as part of a </p>
<p>Trick maneuver), or slowly light an object over the </p>
<p>course of a few rounds (as if holding a match to it).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Water:</b> The caster can conjure up to a pint </p>
<p>of water somewhere within his sight (not “inside” </p>
<p>objects or people). A wave of his hand also purifies </p>
<p>one  gallon  of  water,  whether  it  be  poisoned  or </p>
<p>simply salt-water. Those who have been poisoned </p>
<p>within the last minute also get a second chance </p>
<p>to resist any remaining effects.</p>

<p>This power allows the character to restrain a </p>
<p>target with snaking vines, lengths of hair, spider </p>
<p>webs, or some other vine-like trapping.</p>
<p>The arcane skill roll is opposed by the target’s </p>

<p><i>Light/obscure </i> can  be  cast  on  an  inanimate </p>

<p><i>Pummel</i>  allows  a  character  to  knock  down </p>

<p>of the character’s arcane skill versus the target’s </p>
<p>Spirit. The user must score a success and beat the </p>

<p>instead of the usual one. Each turn is handled </p>
<p>independently  with  its  own  actions,  but  the </p>

<p><b>Trappings:</b> “Morphing,” talismans, tattoos.</p>
<p>Many  cultures  have  legends  of  shamans  or </p>
<p>wizards who take on the shape of animals. This </p>
<p>power does just that. This version of the power </p>
<p>only  allows  a  user  to  transform  into  mundane </p>
<p>animals,  but  more  bizarre  transmutations  may </p>
<p>be found.</p>
<p>A character may learn this spell while of Novice </p>
<p>Rank but cannot transform into the more powerful </p>
<p>creatures until he attains the appropriate Rank. </p>
<p>The cost in Power Points depends on the type </p>
<p>of creature the character wishes to change into. </p>
<p>Use the Shape Change table as a guideline for </p>
<p>unlisted creatures. </p>
<p>Weapons  and  other  personal  effects  are </p>
<p>assumed  into  the  animal’s  form  and  reappear </p>
<p>when  the  power  ends,  but  other  objects  are </p>
<p>dropped. </p>
<p>While  transformed,  the  character  retains  his </p>
<p>own Smarts, Spirit, and linked skills (though he </p>
<p>may  not  be  able  to  use  them  since  he  cannot </p>
<p>speak). He gains the animal’s Agility, Strength, </p>
<p>and linked skills and cannot use most devices. </p>
<p>He has no capacity for speech and cannot use </p>
<p>powers,  though  he  may  continue  to  maintain </p>
<p>powers previously activated. Vigor is the higher </p>
<p>of the caster’s or the creature’s.</p>
<p>The GM has final say on what an animal can and </p>
<p>cannot do. A shaman in dog-form might be able </p>
<p>to pull the trigger on a shotgun, for instance, but </p>
<p>would use a default skill roll of d4–2 as the animal </p>
<p>has no Shooting score of its own. The shaman’s </p>
<p>Persuasion functions normally, but might suffer a </p>
<p>–4 or worse penalty without speech, depending </p>
<p>on what he tries to accomplish.</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> 3 (1/round)</p>
<p><b>Trappings:</b>  Call  elemental,  ghostly  dog, </p>
<p>dimensional double.</p>
<p>This power allows the character to summon a </p>
<p>loyal  and  obedient  servant.  On  a  success,  the </p>
<p>ally is placed at any point within the range of the </p>
<p>power. On a raise, the ally is more durable and </p>
<p>gains  the  Hardy  ability. A  summoned  ally  acts </p>
<p>on the initiative card of the caster and gets an </p>
<p>immediate action as soon as it is summoned.</p>
<p>All Allies are Extras, even Mirror Selves (see </p>
<p>below).</p>
<p>A character may learn this spell while of Novice </p>
<p>Rank, but he cannot summon more powerful allies </p>
<p>until he attains the appropriate Rank. The cost </p>
<p>in Power Points depends on the type of ally the </p>
<p>character wishes to summon. Use the Summon </p>
<p>Ally table as a guideline for unlisted creatures.</p>
<p>A  caster  of  sufficient  Rank  to  summon  more </p>
<p>powerful allies may instead choose to summon </p>
<p>additional lower Rank allies instead at the same </p>
<p>cost. For each decrease in Rank, he gains one </p>
<p>additional  ally.  For  example,  a  Veteran  caster </p>
<p>could  spend  5  Power  Points  to  summon  one </p>
<p>Veteran-Rank-allowed ally, two Seasoned-Rank-</p>
<p>allowed  allies,  or  three  Novice-Rank-allowed </p>
<p>allies. Allies summoned by a single casting must </p>
<p>all be of the same type.</p>

<p>Mirror.Self</p>
<p>This is an ally that appears identical to the caster </p>
<p>but with the following differences. The ally is an </p>
<p>Extra as normal for the power. The duplicate has </p>
<p>half the total Power Points of the caster, and all of </p>
<p>the duplicate’s Traits are one die type less than the </p>
<p>caster’s Traits (to a minimum of d4). The duplicate </p>
<p>has identical mundane equipment, but none of it </p>
<p>has any magical qualities.</p>
<p>Telekinesis</p>
<p><b>Rank:</b> Seasoned</p>
<p><b>Power Points:</b> 5</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--138</p>
<p><b>Range:</b> Smarts</p>
<p><b>Duration:</b> 3 (1/round)</p>
<p><b>Trappings:</b> A  wave  of  the  hand,  magic  wand, </p>
<p>steely gaze.</p>
<p><i>Telekinesis</i> is the ability to move a single object </p>
<p>or creature (including one’s self) with arcane will. </p>
<p>The weight a caster can lift is equal to 10 pounds </p>
<p>times his Spirit die type, 50 pounds times his Spirit </p>
<p>with a raise.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Lifting Creatures:</b> Living targets may resist </p>
<p>with an opposed Spirit roll. If the roll is greater than </p>
<p>the caster’s skill total, the victim is unaffected. If the </p>
<p>creature loses, however, it is lifted as usual and </p>
<p>does not get another attempt to break free.</p>
<p>Occasionally  a  victim  might  manage  to  grab </p>
<p>onto something solid to prevent itself from being </p>
<p>lifted. When this happens, the victim may make an </p>
<p>opposed Strength roll versus the caster’s arcane </p>
<p>skill. If the victim is successful, he manages to </p>
<p>grab  onto  whatever  was  available  and  is  not </p>
<p>moved, bashed, or otherwise affected that round.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Telekinetic  Weapons:</b> A  caster  can  use </p>
<p><i>telekinesis</i> to wield a weapon. When this occurs, </p>
<p>the  weapon’s  Fighting  is  equal  to  his  arcane </p>
<p>skill,  and  its  damage  is  based  on  the  caster’s </p>
<p>Spirit instead of his Strength. A sword that does </p>
<p>Strength+d6 damage, for example, does Spirit+d6 </p>
<p>when  wielded  by <i> telekinesis</i>.  The  weapon </p>
<p>otherwise functions normally, including granting </p>
<p>bonus damage when it strikes with a raise.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Dropping  Things:</b>  Particularly  ruthless </p>
<p>characters often use <i>telekinesis</i> to drop their foes </p>
<p>or bash them into walls and the like. A creature </p>
<p>affected by this power can be moved up to the </p>
<p>caster’s Smarts in inches per turn in any direction. </p>
<p>Dropped creatures suffer falling damage as usual.</p>
<p>Victims who are bashed into walls or other solid </p>
<p>objects suffer the caster’s Spirit+d6 as damage. If </p>
<p>a caster with a d12 Spirit smashes an orc into a </p>
<p>wall, for example, the orc suffers d12+d6 damage.</p>
<p>Teleport</p>
<p><b>Rank:</b> Seasoned</p>
<p><b>Power Points:</b> 3+</p>
<p><b>Range:</b> Special</p>
<p><b>Duration:</b> Instant</p>
<p><b>Trappings:</b> A  cloud  of  smoke,  “phasing”  out, </p>
<p>change into a bolt of lightning.</p>
<p><i>Teleport</i>  allows  a  character  to  disappear  and </p>
<p>instantly  reappear  up  to  10”  distant  for  each  3 </p>
<p>Power  Points  spent,  or  15”  with  a  raise. This </p>
<p>counts as his movement for the round. Adjacent </p>
<p>opponents do not get a free attack against the </p>
<p>teleporting character. If the hero wishes to <i>teleport</i> </p>
<p>somewhere he can’t see, he must make a Smarts </p>
<p>roll at –2. If it is an unknown area he has never </p>
<p>seen, the roll is at a –4 penalty.</p>
<p>Failure of either roll means the teleporter hit an </p>
<p>object of some sort. He returns where he came </p>
<p>from and is Shaken. A roll of 1 on the casting die </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--139</p>
<p>Powers</p>
<p>(regardless  of  the  Wild  Die)  indicates  a  more </p>
<p>serious disaster — in addition to being Shaken he </p>
<p>also suffers 2d6 damage.</p>
<p> The teleporter can never enter a solid space </p>
<p>even if he tries. The power instantly returns him </p>
<p>to his starting location as above.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Carrying Others:</b> The hero can carry other </p>
<p>beings with him at the cost of a level of Fatigue per </p>
<p>additional “rider.” More than two may be carried </p>
<p>at once, but causes instant Incapacitation. One </p>
<p>Fatigue level is regained for each full hour of rest.</p>
<p>Wall.Walker</p>
<p><b>Rank:</b> Novice</p>
<p><b>Power Points:</b> 2</p>
<p><b>Range:</b> Touch</p>
<p><b>Duration:</b> 3 (1/round)</p>
<p><b>Trappings:</b> A crushed spider, bit of web, piece </p>
<p>of tentacle.</p>
<p>Spellcasters are frequently targeted in combat </p>
<p>because of their arcane prowess and high-utility </p>
<p>spells  such  as  this  are  great  for  getting  the </p>
<p>caster safely out of harm’s way. Of course, it has </p>
<p>countless other uses too.</p>
<p><i>Wall walker</i> allows the recipient to function much </p>
<p>like a human spider. He can stick to any surface, </p>
<p>allowing him to climb walls and even hang from the </p>
<p>ceiling. With a success, the character can move </p>
<p>along such surfaces at half his normal Pace. With </p>
<p>a raise, he may move at full Pace and even run.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Additional Targets:</b> The character may affect </p>
<p>up to five targets by spending a like amount of </p>
<p>additional Power Points. </p>
<p>Warrior’s.Gift</p>
<p><b>Rank:</b> Seasoned</p>
<p><b>Power Points:</b> 4</p>
<p><b>Range:</b> Touch</p>
<p><b>Duration:</b> 3 (1/round)</p>
<p><b>Trappings:</b> Gestures, prayer, whispered words, </p>
<p>concentration.</p>
<p>Even  combat  mages  cannot  afford  to  spend </p>
<p>all  their  time  learning  new  combat  maneuvers </p>
<p>and martial skills. For those who enjoy the thrill </p>
<p>of melee or want to improve their companions’ </p>
<p>skills,  this  spell  provides  a  quick  solution  to  a </p>
<p>lack of training.</p>
<p>With a successful arcane skill roll, the recipient </p>
<p>gains the benefits of a single Combat Edge chosen </p>
<p>by the caster. The caster (not the recipient) must </p>
<p>be one Rank higher than the Rank requirement </p>
<p>of the Edge but ignores other requirements, even </p>
<p>those requiring other Edges. For the duration of </p>
<p>the spell, the recipient gains all the benefits of </p>
<p>the Edge.</p>
<p>Edges  gained  through  this  power  provide  no </p>
<p>additional  benefit  if  the  character  already  has </p>
<p>the Edge.</p>

<p><b>Rank:</b> Veteran</p>
<p><b>Power Points:</b> 3/corpse</p>
<p><b>Range:</b> Smarts</p>
<p><b>Duration:</b> Special</p>
<p><b>Trappings:</b> Carving symbols on corpses, throwing </p>
<p>bones, graveyards, “leather” books.</p>
<p>This power is considered evil in most settings, </p>
<p>and  so  is  typically  used  only  by  villainous </p>
<p>nonplayer characters such as necromancers, evil </p>
<p>scientists, dark cultists, and the like.</p>
<p>When cast, <i>zombie</i> raises a number of dead </p>
<p>specified  by  the  character  when  he  spent  his </p>
<p>Power  Points.  The  undead  are  immediately </p>
<p>obedient, though perhaps a bit mischievous and </p>
<p>literal-minded in their duties.</p>
<p>Corpses  aren’t  summoned  by  this  ability,  so </p>
<p>there must actually be a supply of bodies available </p>
<p>for the power to have any effect. The bodies don’t </p>
<p>have  to  be  fresh — <i>zombie</i>  can  raise  servants </p>
<p>that  have  been  waiting  patiently  for  centuries. </p>
<p>Graveyards,  morgues,  and  battlefields  can  all </p>
<p>serve this purpose.</p>
<p>With a success, the dead remain animated for 1 </p>
<p>hour. With a raise, they remain animated for 1d6 </p>
<p>hours. With two raises, they remain animated for </p>
<p>an entire day.</p>
<p>Certain  powerful  necromancers  may  have </p>
<p>improved versions of this power that are cheaper </p>
<p>to cast and create permanent undead.</p>

<p>A group of heroes emarks upon an epic quest. </p>
<p>Terrible monsters and bitter rivals oppose them. </p>
<p>The elements are against them. Mysteries must </p>
<p>be solved, artifacts found, innocents saved.</p>
<p>It’s your job as Game Master to bring all these </p>
<p>fantastic elements to life, to challenge your players </p>
<p>with adventure beyond their wildest imaginations, </p>
<p>and provide a framework to find out if they succeed </p>
<p>in their ultimate goal—or fail.</p>
<p>This is the fun and excitement of being a Game </p>
<p>Master—of creating, managing, and presenting </p>
<p>an entire world of excitement and adventure to </p>
<p>your closest friends. It can be one of the most </p>
<p>satisfying  entertainment  experiences  there  is, </p>
<p>and <i>Savage Worlds</i> is designed to help you wring </p>
<p>every tension-filled moment and gut-busting laugh </p>
<p>from it.</p>
<p>You’ve read the rules and probably have more </p>
<p>ideas for a new campaign than you know what </p>
<p>to do with. Before you do, let’s take a moment to </p>
<p>talk about the art of being a good Game Master, </p>
<p>creating worlds, and putting together memorable </p>
<p>and exciting adventures.</p>
<p>Learning.the.Rules</p>
<p>You need to know how to make Trait rolls, use </p>
<p>Wild Dice, resolve attacks, and handle wounds. </p>
<p>Everything  else  in  this  book,  from  combat </p>
<p>maneuvers  to  Interludes,  can  be  ignored  until </p>
<p>you need it.</p>
<p>A great way to do this is to run a very simple </p>
<p>fight on your own first. Put a Wild Card fighter and </p>
<p>three orcs on the table in front of you and have at </p>
<p>it. Your only goal is to get a feel for rolling the dice, </p>
<p>figuring totals from Aces and modifiers, rolling and </p>
<p>applying  damage,  Soaking  wounds.  If  you  can </p>
<p>handle that, you can run a game.</p>
<p>Your.Game</p>
<p>You might think that the first step in starting a </p>
<p>new game is finding a group of people to play </p>
<p>with. That is important, but that’s your next step. </p>
<p>Your first step is to get <i>yourself</i> excited. Do that </p>
<p>and you’ll likely get all your friends excited as well.</p>
<p>Start  by figuring out  what  kind  of setting  you </p>
<p>want to run. What kind of characters might people </p>
<p>play? What might a typical adventure be like? Jot </p>
<p>down a few notes about what makes your game </p>
<p>cool, who the bad guys are, what kinds of magic </p>
<p>or other supernatural aspects are present, and </p>
<p>what  your  basic  storyline  is.  If  you  have  these </p>
<p>elements, you’ve got enough information to “sell” </p>
<p>your game to your friends and get them to play.</p>
<p>Game.Night</p>
<p>Now  it’s  time  to  recruit.  You’ve  got  a  great </p>
<p>campaign idea and enough information about it to </p>
<p>explain it to your friends. The next step is to find </p>
<p>out who wants to play, and when they can do it.</p>
<p>When  you’re  finding  out  who  wants  to  play, </p>
<p>first ask <i>when</i> each person can make it. It’s very </p>
<p>important that you set both a time and a regular </p>
<p>day to play. If you rely on a fluctuating week-to-</p>
<p>week schedule, you’re almost certainly doomed </p>
<p>to failure. People have busy lives, and as much </p>
<p>as everyone involved might love to play, they’ve </p>
<p>still  got  to  study  for  classes,  take  care  of  their </p>
<p>children, and otherwise live their lives. If you have </p>
<p>a set night every week, it’s much easier for your </p>
<p>friends to schedule most of their activities around </p>
<p>game night. It also helps you know when you’ve </p>
<p>got to be ready to run.</p>
<p>Don’t rule out playing on weeknights. Friday and </p>
<p>Saturday are great if you’re single or in college, </p>
<p>but difficult for players who need weekend nights </p>
<p>to be with their families. If you start at 6 p.m., your </p>
<p>players have time to get off work, grab some food </p>
<p>(or share pizza with the group), and get deep into </p>
<p>the game by 7 or so.</p>
<p>For most groups, you should wrap things up by </p>
<p>11 p.m. or so. Most people tend to get a little tired </p>
<p>by then and you don’t want game night to be a </p>
<p>stressful experience. Talk it over with the group </p>
<p>and see what works for them. Setting some basic </p>
<p>rules will help everyone schedule and makes it </p>
<p>far more likely everyone will show up week after </p>
<p>week.</p>
<p>Chapter.Six:.</p>
<p>Game.Mastering</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--141</p>
<p>A  wise  Game  Master  tries  to  end  each  night </p>
<p>with a bit of a cliffhanger as well. If your players </p>
<p>are talking during the week about what’s going to </p>
<p>happen next, you’ve done your job well.</p>
<p>Character.Types</p>
<p>Once  you’ve  got  a  few  friends  interested, </p>
<p>it’s  great  if  you  can  give  them  a  little  primer </p>
<p>information and find out what kind of characters </p>
<p>they  want  to  play. You  don’t  need  everyone  to </p>
<p>make characters at this point—character creation </p>
<p>is  fast  enough  that  they  can  do  it  at  your  first </p>
<p>session if you want. But if some of your friends </p>
<p>have neat ideas as to their background or basic </p>
<p>type (fighter, investigator, etc.), you can start doing </p>
<p>more detail work on your story. If you’re going to </p>
<p>run <i>Evernight</i>, for example, and all your friends </p>
<p>make  combat  types,  you  know  they’re  looking </p>
<p>for  a  high-action,  “hack  and  slash”  type  game. </p>
<p>That doesn’t mean you can’t mix in lots of other </p>
<p>elements—exploration, horror, deep roleplaying, </p>
<p>and so on—but every now and then you’ll want </p>
<p>to have a big nasty combat as well. </p>
<p>Getting.the.Party.Together</p>
<p>The  first  thing  you  need  to  do  in  any  new </p>
<p>adventure  or  campaign  is  figure  out  why  the </p>
<p>characters are together. There are two common </p>
<p>ways to handle this.</p>
<p>The.Mission</p>
<p>The most common way of building a party is for </p>
<p>an employer to offer a reward for adventurers to </p>
<p>complete some task. Perhaps they answer a want </p>
<p>ad, are hired in a smoky tavern, or are called on </p>
<p>by connections or friends. Either way, the heroes </p>
<p>are then thrown together by fate and must learn </p>
<p>to work as a team.</p>
<p>There’s a problem that sometimes arises from </p>
<p>this  approach.  Say  you’re  running  a  fantasy </p>
<p>campaign and the mission is to deliver a message </p>
<p>to a distant city. But one of the characters in your </p>
<p>group is a witch hunter. His player is all excited </p>
<p>about making such a unique character, but you </p>
<p>need  him  (and  the  others)  to  be  a  courier  for </p>
<p>now and accept the assignment to kick off your </p>
<p>campaign.</p>
<p>Fortunately,  there’s  an  easy  way  to  fix  this. </p>
<p>Instead  of  arguing  with  the  player  about  his </p>
<p>character’s  motivations,  let  the <i> player</i>  figure  it </p>
<p>out. Be honest and tell him that this is what you </p>
<p>need to get things started. Maybe the witch hunter </p>
<p>is simply between jobs. Or maybe he’s working </p>
<p>under cover to root out some evil sorceress, or </p>
<p>needs to earn some gold to buy better arms and </p>
<p>equipment for his task. Or maybe the employer or </p>
<p>the recipient is an old friend (or enemy).</p>
<p>This approach not only helps get things moving, </p>
<p>but may establish an entirely new and interesting </p>
<p>subplot for your campaign!</p>
<p>Former.Acquaintances</p>
<p>You  can  also  start  a  campaign  with  all  the </p>
<p>characters  already  knowing  each  other.  This </p>
<p>works great for getting the game moving, and is </p>
<p>very appropriate for certain campaign types. <i>Weird </i></p>
<p><i>Wars</i> games in particular, for example, are often </p>
<p>best run where the soldiers have served together </p>
<p>for a bit and know at least the basic faults and </p>
<p>vices of their companions. This is also a great way </p>
<p>to kick off a convention game where your group </p>
<p>only has a few hours to play.</p>
<p>The downside of starting a campaign like this </p>
<p>is that some players may feel cheated if they put </p>
<p>a lot of work into their characters’ backgrounds. </p>
<p>Players  often  come  up  with  deep  backstories </p>
<p>for  their  heroes. This  shows  great  imagination </p>
<p>and  enthusiasm  for  your  game  and  should  be </p>
<p>encouraged.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, unless you’ve set the character </p>
<p>up as an important person in your setting and his </p>
<p>background figures prominently in the events that </p>
<p>are to come, it’s very likely all that work will never </p>
<p>come to light. The reason why is that individual </p>
<p>backgrounds likely aren’t part of your overall plot, </p>
<p>and characters don’t engage in revealing small </p>
<p>talk like real people do. (But see Interludes on </p>
<p>page 105!)</p>
<p>Staying.Together</p>
<p>After the first adventure, the players may wonder </p>
<p>exactly why their characters might stay together. </p>
<p>This is easy if they’re employed  by a common </p>
<p>benefactor, or if similar  groups are  common  to </p>
<p>the  setting  (adventuring  crews,  military  teams, </p>
<p>and so on).</p>
<p>Staying together might be more difficult if the </p>
<p>campaign goal isn’t very clear, or if some of the </p>
<p>characters don’t get along that well. How to fix this </p>
<p>depends a lot on the type of game you’re running. </p>
<p>If there’s a clear, overall objective or over-arching </p>
<p>storyline, the party might stay together to defeat </p>
<p>the  greater  evil,  even  if  they  aren’t  the  best  of </p>
<p>friends.</p>
<p>If the campaign goal is more ambiguous, the </p>
<p>best answer may be to <i>not</i> force the heroes to </p>
<p>stay together. Consider a modern horror game. </p>
<p>The  players  are  thrust  together  in  a  haunted </p>
<p>mansion for a weekend. Terrible things occur, but </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--142</p>
<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p>eventually at least some of the player characters </p>
<p>survive and stagger back into daylight. Why would </p>
<p>they then go out hunting vampires or searching </p>
<p>for zombies the following week just because they </p>
<p>had one incredible encounter?</p>
<p>Maybe  they  don’t.  Maybe  they  all  go  home </p>
<p>and try to forget what happened just like normal </p>
<p>folks. Let a few days or weeks of nothing happen </p>
<p>(narratively, of course). Later on though, one of </p>
<p>the  characters  gets  involved  in  another  creepy </p>
<p>encounter. This time out, however, he knows at </p>
<p>least a few other people who won’t laugh at him </p>
<p>or throw him in the loony bin, so <i>he</i> calls and asks </p>
<p>the other player characters for help.</p>
<p>Friction</p>
<p>So  what  happens  if  your  group  doesn’t  get </p>
<p>along? That depends on whether it’s the players </p>
<p>or the characters who are arguing.</p>
<p>We  won’t  give  you  advice  on  how  to  handle </p>
<p>conflicts with your friends. You know them best, </p>
<p>and  will  have  to  figure  out  if  there  are  certain </p>
<p>friends  who  just  don’t  fit  in  your  campaign. </p>
<p>Remember though that friends are more important </p>
<p>than games—even ours. If you and the rest of </p>
<p>the  group  can’t  talk  out  your  differences,  find </p>
<p>something else to do for a while that doesn’t cause </p>
<p>such friction. Maybe you can come back to the </p>
<p>game once you’ve worked things out.</p>
<p>Friction between characters, on the other hand, </p>
<p>is not only fine, it’s actually encouraged to some </p>
<p>degree. Any  interesting  group  of  personalities </p>
<p>squabble and argue on occasion. As long as this </p>
<p>is  done  in  character,  it  adds  to  the  roleplaying </p>
<p>experience and the depth of your campaign. Quiet </p>
<p>fights between the heroes can often take on a life </p>
<p>of their own, encouraging players to take you, the </p>
<p>Game Master, aside or write you private notes </p>
<p>about actions their heroes perform away from the </p>
<p>prying eyes of others.</p>
<p>Campaign.Types</p>
<p>Different groups like different types of games. </p>
<p>Some like lots of combat, others prefer to run fast </p>
<p>and loose with more roleplaying and less “hack </p>
<p>and slash.” Most people mix all these elements </p>
<p>together. When you cut to the chase, there are </p>
<p>basically three campaign types: Hack and Slash, </p>
<p>Roleplaying, and Exploration.</p>
<p>Hack.and.Slash</p>
<p>A Hack and Slash game features lots of combat. </p>
<p>With <i>Savage Worlds,</i> you can do more than pit </p>
<p>your five player characters against a couple of </p>
<p>orcs and an ogre. You can throw a whole horde at </p>
<p>your heroes, and give them a few staunch allies </p>
<p>or henchmen to help as well!</p>
<p>The best part is that players who just want to </p>
<p>wade into the forces of darkness with two blades </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--143</p>
<p>Game.Mastering</p>
<p>slashing can do it. More tactically-minded players </p>
<p>can load up on Leadership Edges and direct the </p>
<p>actions of hirelings and allies.</p>
<p>Players who like to think on their feet can take </p>
<p>advantage of acrobatic maneuvers and the like to </p>
<p>describe their heroes’ actions down to the most </p>
<p>minute details.</p>
<p>Exploration</p>
<p>Exploring lost cities, finding forgotten treasures, </p>
<p>or reclaiming fallen civilizations is always exciting </p>
<p>for the players. The Great Unknown lurks behind </p>
<p>every  pile  of  toppled  columns,  and  Incredible </p>
<p>Treasures await those brave enough to take them </p>
<p>from their mysterious guardians.</p>
<p>The trouble with exploration games is that they’re </p>
<p>often difficult for you, the Game Master, to create. </p>
<p>All those incredible surprises, fearsome beasts, </p>
<p>and awesome treasures have to be created by </p>
<p>you. Fortunately, <i>Savage Worlds</i> makes it easy </p>
<p>to quickly create just about any creature, magic </p>
<p>item, or other surprise you can dream up.</p>
<p>One important tip here. The players don’t have </p>
<p>access to your creatures’ statistics unless you give </p>
<p>it to them. If you describe mysterious creatures of </p>
<p>different shapes and sizes, don’t kill yourself trying </p>
<p>to make their statistics vastly different.</p>
<p>Roleplaying</p>
<p>Perhaps the trickiest type of campaign to run is </p>
<p>one that involves deep roleplaying. It’s very easy </p>
<p>to handle rules-wise—there likely won’t be much </p>
<p>die rolling besides a few Persuasion rolls here and </p>
<p>there. The tricky part is handling all the different </p>
<p>Extras and interacting with the player characters. </p>
<p>Again, being able to create characters on the fly </p>
<p>helps tremendously here. You can jot down a few </p>
<p>notes about a character’s most important skills </p>
<p>and then move on. That way you can concentrate </p>
<p>on giving your Extras more personality and worry </p>
<p>less about how good they are at obscure skills.</p>
<p>Another thing to be careful of when running a </p>
<p>game that’s heavy on roleplaying is making sure </p>
<p>there are at least a few events scheduled to give </p>
<p>the group something to talk about. If the majority </p>
<p>of your adventure is a bunch of people standing in </p>
<p>a room, you’re likely in for a slow night. If they’re </p>
<p>in a room trying to find out which one of them is a </p>
<p>murderer, the action will likely be quite exciting. </p>
<p>And if the lights occasionally go out and another </p>
<p>victim  turns  up  dead,  the  interaction  between </p>
<p>characters can easily get as exciting as the most </p>
<p>knock-down, drag-out dungeon crawl.</p>
<p>Horror</p>
<p>Most every game has an element of horror to </p>
<p>it. New Game Masters often ask how to handle </p>
<p>horror in their games. They have visions in their </p>
<p>heads  of  their  friends  sitting  around  shivering </p>
<p>in  utter  terror  as  gruesome  fiends  stalk  their </p>
<p>underpowered investigators.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that’s not too likely. There may </p>
<p>certainly be moments like that, but more likely, </p>
<p>your group will be sitting around eating nachos </p>
<p>and making bad jokes to each other most of the </p>
<p>night. The worst thing you can do is try and stop </p>
<p>them.  Remember  that  they’re  there  to  have  a </p>
<p>good  time  and  socialize  while  exercising  their </p>
<p>own  imaginations.  Let  them  enjoy  themselves </p>
<p>and  don’t  try  to  be  overly  oppressive  with  the </p>
<p>spooky stuff.</p>
<p>When the time comes and the weirdness begins, </p>
<p>subtly change the tone a bit. Smile and dim the </p>
<p>lights, then turn on some creepy music—just loud </p>
<p>enough for them to hear it without being too overt. </p>
<p>If what you’re running is genuinely creepy, your </p>
<p>group will be relaxed and willing to go with the flow </p>
<p>and let the heebie-jeebies take over. Try and <i>force</i> </p>
<p>them and it will almost certainly backfire.</p>
<p>Whatever  you  do,  when  the  group  finally </p>
<p>encounters some horrid monster, make sure to </p>
<p>describe it rather than refer to it by name. A “large, </p>
<p>lanky, green-skinned creature with drool dripping </p>
<p>from its fangs and beady black eyes” is much more </p>
<p>frightening than “a troll.”</p>
<p>Running.the.Game</p>
<p><i>Savage  Worlds</i>  has  been  designed  from  the </p>
<p>ground up to make the job of the Game Master as </p>
<p>easy as possible. The designers and playtesters </p>
<p>of  this  game  want  to  concentrate  on  playing </p>
<p>the  game  and  making  incredible  and  exciting </p>
<p>memories. We aren’t interested in spending hours </p>
<p>before the game creating statistics for Karlos the </p>
<p>Innkeeper.</p>
<p>That means that when preparing for your game, </p>
<p>you can concentrate on creating intricate plots, </p>
<p>tricky  puzzles,  and  interesting  characters. You </p>
<p>don’t  have  to  do  complex  math  to  make  your </p>
<p>nonplayer  characters  and  monsters,  and  you </p>
<p>certainly don’t need to spend an hour on some </p>
<p>computer program just to make up a few bandits.</p>
<p>Your job is kept easy during the game as well </p>
<p>since there’s very little bookkeeping. You might </p>
<p>have to track a few Wild Card villains’ wounds, but </p>
<p>other than that, the bad guys are up, Shaken, or </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--144</p>
<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p>removed from play. You can focus on describing </p>
<p>the action instead of trying to record “2 hit points </p>
<p>of damage on the skeleton figure with the chipped </p>
<p>paint on his sword.”</p>
<p>Take advantage of these things to give yourself </p>
<p>a  break  and  run  a  game  like  you  never  have </p>
<p>before. If you <i>want </i>to spend a lot of time on your </p>
<p>campaign, make some cool props or develop your </p>
<p>nonplayer characters’ personalities and plots—not </p>
<p>their game statistics.</p>
<p>Introducing.New.Players</p>
<p>Getting  your  friends  to  try  a  new  game, </p>
<p>especially if they’re used to one system and don’t </p>
<p>like to try many others, can be pretty difficult. We </p>
<p>recommend  downloading  the Test  Drive  rules </p>
<p>from our website and giving them to each of your </p>
<p>friends. This will show them what <i>Savage Worlds</i> </p>
<p>is all about and encourage them to try it at least </p>
<p>once. If you run one of the free adventures from </p>
<p>our site, complete with pregenerated characters, </p>
<p>it should be very easy for everyone to jump in, </p>
<p>play  a  short  session,  and  figure  out  if  it’s  for </p>
<p>them. We hope it is of course. If so, you can then </p>
<p>try  something  with  a  little  more  meat,  such  as </p>
<p><i>Deadlands, Necessary Evil, Slipstream,</i> or even a </p>
<p>world of your own creation. If you like these rules </p>
<p>but have a favorite game world, you can convert </p>
<p>it over (see page 148).</p>
<p>Balance</p>
<p>Some games have very strict rules for how to </p>
<p>balance encounters so that every fight is “fair.” The </p>
<p>battle might be a tough one, but it’s still expected </p>
<p>the heroes can win if they play smart and have </p>
<p>decent luck.</p>
<p>In <i>Savage Worlds</i>, most setpiece encounters </p>
<p>should be reasonably balanced for the expected </p>
<p>power  level  of  the  group.  But  this  isn’t  always </p>
<p>the case.  Sometimes  it’s just  as interesting  for </p>
<p>the  players  to  evaluate  a  situation  and  realize </p>
<p>they probably can’t win—at least not by charging </p>
<p>in  guns  blazing. This  is  desirable  on  occasion </p>
<p>as  it  encourages  the  group  to  think,  talk,  plan, </p>
<p>and come up with clever solutions to the most </p>
<p>challenging situations.</p>
<p>Game Masters should never be afraid to let the </p>
<p>opposition flex their muscles. These are <i>savage</i> </p>
<p>worlds, after all, and triumphing against these foes </p>
<p>should be a major accomplishment—not a given.</p>
<p>Combat.Ratings</p>
<p>Once you’ve played <i>Savage Worlds</i> for a while </p>
<p>you should have a good feel for how many bad </p>
<p>guys to throw at your adventurers. New Game </p>
<p>Masters might want a little guidance. The system </p>
<p>below gives you a baseline to start from, but make </p>
<p>sure  to  also  think  about  additional  advantages </p>
<p>either side might have (such as traps, support, </p>
<p>powerful magic items, or favorable terrain).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Start  your  estimate  by  getting  a  Combat </p>
<p>Rating  for  each  player  character  equal  to </p>
<p>half the maximum damage he does with his </p>
<p>typical attack. So a fighter with a d8 Strength </p>
<p>and a short sword (Str+d6 damage) has a </p>
<p>Damage Rating of 7 (14/2). A wizard who </p>
<p>typically  uses  the <i> bolt</i>  power  averages  a </p>
<p>standard bolt attack of 2d6, or 6 (12/2).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Add  +1  for  each  Combat  Edge  or  special </p>
<p>ability,  and  another  +1  for  each  point  of </p>
<p>Toughness over 5.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Do the same for any allies. If a character isn’t </p>
<p>a Wild Card, his Combat Rating is halved.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Now add all the player characters’ Combat </p>
<p>Ratings together to find the party’s Combat </p>
<p>Rating.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Use  the  same  system  for  the  villains </p>
<p>(counting combat special abilities as Combat </p>
<p>Edges).</p>
<p>Now compare each side’s values. If the party’s </p>
<p>Combat Rating is 50, for example, your opposition </p>
<p>should be a little less for an easy encounter, about </p>
<p>even for a moderate encounter, and a little more </p>
<p>for a tough fight.</p>
<p>If  the  villains’  Combat  Rating  is  two  or  more </p>
<p>times the heroes’ total they’re likely going to learn </p>
<p>how to retreat.</p>
<p>Experience</p>
<p>You should usually award two experience points </p>
<p>per game session. That means your players get to </p>
<p>upgrade their characters every two or three game.</p>
<p>When  you  end  longer  adventures,  story  arcs </p>
<p>that  take  four  to  six  sessions  or  so,  you  might </p>
<p>want to award three points, but any more should </p>
<p>be reserved for really big events. Keeping your </p>
<p>average  award  to  two  means  your  characters </p>
<p>progress  at  a  more  natural  rate,  and  won’t  be </p>
<p>Legendary  warriors  after  only  a  few  months  of </p>
<p>play.</p>
<p>Starting.With.Experienced.Characters</p>
<p>In  general,  player  characters  at  the  start  of </p>
<p><i>Savage Worlds</i> campaigns have a little training </p>
<p>and talent, but haven’t had many adventures on </p>
<p>their own yet.</p>
<p>You may occasionally want to start a campaign </p>
<p>with  more  experienced  characters.  That’s </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--145</p>
<p>Game.Mastering</p>
<p>encouraged for really difficult worlds, or for shorter </p>
<p>campaigns where the heroes need to get to the </p>
<p>heart of the action a little quicker. A commando </p>
<p>raid in World War Two, an assault on a lich’s lair, </p>
<p>or super spies infiltrating a diabolical villain’s base </p>
<p>are not adventures for the inexperienced.</p>
<p>Start experienced characters as Seasoned, or </p>
<p>very rarely, Veterans, when first trying this out. </p>
<p>Once you have a good feel for more experienced </p>
<p>characters, you can go as high as you want.</p>
<p>It’s important to the balancing process to make </p>
<p>your players create their characters as Novices </p>
<p>and  then  “bump”  them  up  through  their  four </p>
<p>progressions per Rank. That maintains a more </p>
<p>realistic progression of attributes and skills, and </p>
<p>ensures they can’t take more advanced Edges </p>
<p>than they would otherwise be entitled to.</p>
<p>It’s also easier to do it this way from a player’s </p>
<p>perspective.  It’s  a  little  tricky  to  add  up  all  the </p>
<p>“points” one would have at Seasoned rank. Bump </p>
<p>up a character from a Novice however and the </p>
<p>advancement system is very simple.</p>
<p>Bennies</p>
<p>Experience is very limited—we encourage you </p>
<p>to  give  out  two  points  just  about  every  game </p>
<p>session.  Bennies  are  much  more  flexible,  and </p>
<p>allow you to reward creative players on the spot </p>
<p>for their actions.</p>
<p>You should hand out a Benny anytime a player </p>
<p>does something particularly clever, finds a very </p>
<p>important  clue,  or  generally  advances  the  plot. </p>
<p>You  should  also  hand  out  Bennies  for  great </p>
<p>roleplaying,  particularly  as  it  concerns  their </p>
<p>Hindrances. If a Loyal character jeopardizes his </p>
<p>life to save his comrade, he definitely deserves </p>
<p>a Benny for his efforts. It never hurts to reward a </p>
<p>player for a great line, side-splitting in-game joke, </p>
<p>or even a rare serious and dramatic moment.</p>
<p>Average  players should  get one  or  two extra </p>
<p>Bennies per night. Really good roleplayers may </p>
<p>wind up with two to three.</p>
<p>Interpret.the.Die.Rolls</p>
<p><i>Savage Worlds</i> frequently features wild and </p>
<p>unpredictable die rolls. When this happens, </p>
<p>go  with  it!  If  a  hero  has  to  jump  from </p>
<p>a  wrecked  car  as  it  careens  out  of </p>
<p>control  and  makes  an  amazing </p>
<p>Agility roll, describe how he leaps </p>
<p>into the air, tucks and rolls on </p>
<p>the  ground,  and </p>
<p>comes  up  on </p>
<p>his feet with </p>
<p>perfect balance. Similarly, don’t be afraid to throw </p>
<p>some bad luck at them when they get a really poor </p>
<p>roll. Maybe while using the Chase rules a player </p>
<p>is skiing down a mountain attempting to escape </p>
<p>a rampaging yeti and rolls snake eyes! Describe </p>
<p>how he tumbles in the snow, rolling and tumbling </p>
<p>as the beast bounds after him and prepares to </p>
<p>make its attack!</p>
<p>Your players will love the extra embellishment, </p>
<p>and they’ll feel powerful and cool when the dice </p>
<p>are nice, and feel danger and excitement when </p>
<p>the dice betray them.</p>
<p>Pacing</p>
<p>A good Game Master must pay attention to the </p>
<p>pace  of  the  game.  Sometimes  your  group  will </p>
<p>want to take their time roleplaying their characters, </p>
<p>interacting with the world, or even just joking out </p>
<p>of character and enjoying the social aspect of the </p>
<p>game. If this goes on too long, however, your party </p>
<p>likely needs a little guidance.</p>
<p>This can be especially true in open adventures </p>
<p>such as a murder mystery that requires the players </p>
<p>to figure out where their characters go and what </p>
<p>they want to do (as opposed to a dungeon crawl or </p>
<p>similar adventure where they </p>
<p>really  only </p>
<p>need  to  decide  if  they’re </p>
<p>pressing forward or not).</p>
<p>In  general,  if  most </p>
<p>or all of the group is </p>
<p>roleplaying, smiling, </p>
<p>and having a good </p>
<p>t i m e — l e a v e </p>
<p>them  alone. </p>
<p>Let  them </p>
<p>s e t </p>
<p>the </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--146</p>
<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p>pace. If you notice some of your players are left </p>
<p>out or looking a little bored, prod them a bit. If </p>
<p>they seem a little lost as to what to do next, ask </p>
<p>one of the group to recount the clues or situation </p>
<p>as they understand it. This will often be enough </p>
<p>to spark an idea or lead they want to follow up </p>
<p>on. You might also introduce new information via </p>
<p>a call or visit from a nonplayer character. Finally, </p>
<p>don’t be afraid to contrive an encounter that gives </p>
<p>the group a new path to follow. Maybe the team </p>
<p>is attacked by the bad guys, and in the aftermath </p>
<p>are able to gather a new clue from the survivors.</p>
<p>Combat.Pacing</p>
<p>Perhaps even more important than pacing at </p>
<p>the  plot  level  is  making  sure  combats  are  fast </p>
<p>and furious. As you count down the Action Cards, </p>
<p>make each player tell you what his character is </p>
<p>doing fairly quickly. If he needs a moment, put his </p>
<p>character on Hold and move on to the next player </p>
<p>(but probably wait if the next actor is a villain).</p>
<p>If  you  feel  the  scene  should  be  particularly </p>
<p>dramatic  and  a  player  doesn’t  announce  his </p>
<p>character’s  intentions  quickly  enough,  start </p>
<p>counting down… “What do you do? 5, 4, 3…!” </p>
<p>That will get all the players’ blood pumping and </p>
<p>reinforce the notion that their characters are in a </p>
<p>dangerous situation that requires quick decisions </p>
<p>and big heroics.</p>
<p>Design.Note.-.The.Countdown</p>
<p><i>The  countdown  is  a  fantastic  tool  for </i></p>
<p><i>instilling  a  sense  of  urgency  into  your </i></p>
<p><i>combats. We’ve run hundreds of games and </i></p>
<p><i>when a player takes too long to figure out </i></p>
<p><i>what they want to do on their turn everyone </i></p>
<p><i>suffers. That’s not to say there aren’t times </i></p>
<p><i>when you want to give them some breathing </i></p>
<p><i>room—particularly if they have a big plan or </i></p>
<p><i>need to look up something really important. </i></p>
<p><i>But most of the time, rush things along. Make </i></p>
<p><i>them feel the urgency of combat. Make them </i></p>
<p><i>a little nervous. Make them realize things are </i></p>
<p><i>desperate and that next die roll better be a </i></p>
<p><i>good one.</i></p>
<p><i>And  of  course,  don’t  be  afraid  to  back </i></p>
<p><i>off  and  give  the  group  time  to  plan  and </i></p>
<p><i>strategize  when  that  makes  sense.  Feel </i></p>
<p><i>the moment and play up the drama befitting </i></p>
<p><i>your  scenario,  the  environment,  and  the </i></p>
<p><i>party’s mood.</i></p>
<p>Extras</p>
<p>The backbone of any good game is the world </p>
<p>that  surrounds  the  player  characters,  and </p>
<p>nonplayer characters are a big part of that. This </p>
<p>section  shows  you  how  to  breathe  life  into  the </p>
<p>supporting cast of your world.</p>
<p>Creating.Extras</p>
<p>Consider this Game Master’s Rule #1 when it </p>
<p>comes to Extras: Don’t “build” them!</p>
<p>Don’t  create  your  Extras  with  the  character </p>
<p>creation rules. Just give them what you think they </p>
<p>ought to have in their various skills and attributes </p>
<p>and move on. Remember this game is supposed </p>
<p>to be easy for you to set up, run, and play. Don’t </p>
<p>sit around adding up skill points for Extras when </p>
<p>you could be designing fiendish traps and thinking </p>
<p>up nasty special abilities for your monsters!</p>
<p>Personality</p>
<p>Far  more  important  than  most  nonplayer </p>
<p>character’s statistics are their personalities. Jot </p>
<p>down a note or two about any Extras the party is </p>
<p>likely to come across so you’ll have some idea how </p>
<p>to run them. Some Game Masters find it useful to </p>
<p>identify prominent Extras with actors or characters </p>
<p>from film, television, books, or comics.</p>
<p>Knowing that the Captain of the City Guard is </p>
<p>“played by Sam Elliot,” for instance, gives you a </p>
<p>good handle on how to handle interactions with </p>
<p>him. He’s likely to be gruff, to the point, and have </p>
<p>a deep, throaty voice.</p>
<p>Adding these extra touches to the characters can </p>
<p>really make them stand out and be remembered </p>
<p>by  your  players  as  well. That  way  the  captain </p>
<p>becomes a memorable character they may call on </p>
<p>in the future rather than just a one-shot resource </p>
<p>they forget about by the next scene. Not every </p>
<p>Extra needs this kind of depth of course, but those </p>
<p>that do add a level of realism and continuity to </p>
<p>your game.</p>
<p>Allies</p>
<p>Though it’s rarely written, most games assume </p>
<p>that  the  Game  Master  controls  the  nonplayer </p>
<p>characters,  both  when  they’re  being  talked </p>
<p>to  and  when  they  fight  alongside  the  player </p>
<p>characters  in  combat.  Most  of  the  time,  this </p>
<p>means the overworked GM simply forgets about </p>
<p>the additional characters during a fight, or shoves </p>
<p>them off to the side and narratively describes what </p>
<p>happens to them. This goes for hirelings as well as </p>
<p>animal companions, sidekicks, or love interests. </p>
<p>The simple fact is that in most games, allies are </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--147</p>
<p>Game.Mastering</p>
<p>a cumbersome complication.</p>
<p><i>Savage Worlds</i> takes a very different approach—</p>
<p>we  turn  control  of  allies  over  to  the  player </p>
<p>characters. The GM acts out these allies when </p>
<p>they’re spoken to, of course, but he should very </p>
<p>rarely, if ever, take them over in combat.</p>
<p>If  you  allow  your  heroes  to  have  allies,  you </p>
<p>can include all the minions your villains should </p>
<p>have  as  well.  Picture  an  ancient  lich  cornered </p>
<p>in his unholy “throne” room. Would he be sitting </p>
<p>there alone? No, he’d be surrounded by scores </p>
<p>of ghoulish undead. These lesser minions make </p>
<p>great  complications  for  your  battles,  and  your </p>
<p>players will have fun bashing through them with </p>
<p>the Extras while their heroes battle the lich and </p>
<p>his more capable lieutenants.</p>
<p>This can take a little getting used to. If you’ve </p>
<p>been Game Mastering other games for a long time </p>
<p>and have a hard time letting go of the nonplayer </p>
<p>characters,  we  suggest  you  try  it  for  a  bit  and </p>
<p>see how it works out. You can always change it if </p>
<p>doesn’t make sense for your group.</p>
<p>Artificial.Inflation</p>
<p>When running <i>Savage Worlds</i>, a lot of Game </p>
<p>Masters become extremely enamored with the ally </p>
<p>aspect of the game. That’s great and it’s what we </p>
<p>intend, but it also sometimes leads to very large </p>
<p>parties of player characters and Extras, which then </p>
<p>demand very large parties of opponents.</p>
<p>It’s okay if you do this—the system can handle </p>
<p>it—but  be  warned  that  a  combat  with  50+ </p>
<p>combatants will take a bit, even with a fast and </p>
<p>furious system. To avoid this kind of “inflation,” pay </p>
<p>attention to the size of your party and its nonplayer </p>
<p>characters, and then remember that you’ll need a </p>
<p>lot of enemies to challenge a large group.</p>
<p>Creating.Worlds</p>
<p>Pinnacle  makes  many  incredible  and  award-</p>
<p>winning settings that we hope you’ll check out, but </p>
<p>it’s also fun to create your own worlds to play in. </p>
<p>The game rules and statistics won’t give you any </p>
<p>trouble after you’ve played even a single game, </p>
<p>and you probably don’t <i>need</i> to create a single </p>
<p>Edge, Hindrance, or power (though you may want </p>
<p>to). That means you can concentrate on what your </p>
<p>world is about, what the heroes do there, what </p>
<p>kinds of fantastic treasures they might find, and </p>
<p>who their opponents are.</p>
<p>The.Name</p>
<p>It’s not necessarily the most important part of the </p>
<p>game, but a good name can really help you nail </p>
<p>down the theme. <i>Evernight,</i> for example, is about </p>
<p>a world of perpetual darkness. <i>Deadlands</i> has a </p>
<p>Western feel, and hints at the underlying horror. </p>
<p>You can just guess what <i>Hell on Earth</i> is all about.</p>
<p>If you can come up with a good name for your </p>
<p>game, it may help everyone instantly realize just </p>
<p>what kind of setting it is.</p>
<p>Iconic.Adventures</p>
<p>Perhaps  the  single  strongest  thing  you  can </p>
<p>think of for your new world is what you expect </p>
<p>a typical adventure to be about. If it’s a fantasy </p>
<p>“dungeon crawler,” you expect the heroes to delve </p>
<p>into  multi-leveled  dungeons  fighting  monsters </p>
<p>and gathering treasure. If it’s  an  anti-corporate </p>
<p>cyberpunk  setting,  you  expect  the  team  to  run </p>
<p>missions against secure buildings and battle in </p>
<p>cyberspace.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean all your adventures need to </p>
<p>follow this pattern, but if you set this as a baseline </p>
<p>expectation  players  will  quickly  understand  the </p>
<p>world, what it’s about, and most importantly, their </p>
<p>role in it. Knowing the game will mostly be about </p>
<p>Texas Rangers roaming the frontier fighting crime, </p>
<p>for example, gives a player a very strong guideline </p>
<p>for what kind of character he could make.</p>
<p>Scripted.Adventures</p>
<p>Scripted  adventures  are  more  like  interactive </p>
<p>stories. The players can make choices along the </p>
<p>way, but the overall plot advances more or less </p>
<p>intact regardless of what they do. Epic tales must </p>
<p>sometimes follow this path—it’s hard to tell a story </p>
<p>if you don’t know what chapters are to come.</p>
<p>When running a scripted adventure, try not to </p>
<p>make  your  scenarios <i> feel</i>  scripted. The  group </p>
<p>should never feel like they’re just observers, going </p>
<p>along for the ride no matter what they do. Instead, </p>
<p>use  the  situation,  overwhelming  opponents,  or </p>
<p>“down times” to give the group the illusion they </p>
<p>control  the  story  more  than  they  really  do.  In </p>
<p><i>Evernight</i>, for example, there’s a point where the </p>
<p>heroes  can  do  whatever  they  want  for  a  time. </p>
<p>Eventually,  however,  they  are  captured  by  the </p>
<p>villains of the tale, and begin the next episode </p>
<p>of the story.</p>
<p>Situational.Adventures</p>
<p>Situational adventures are much easier to run if </p>
<p>you’re able to think on your feet as you won’t have </p>
<p>quite as much preparation. In these epic tales, you </p>
<p>present a situation of some sort and then just let </p>
<p>the heroes deal with it however they choose. Say </p>
<p>an evil lich has risen and is creating an army of </p>
<p>undead to destroy the living. What do the heroes </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--148</p>
<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p>do about it? Do they hire on with the local militia? </p>
<p>Do they try and sneak into the cursed lands to </p>
<p>strike down the necromancer himself?</p>
<p>You will need to prepare a few locations, Extras, </p>
<p>and perhaps a few staged encounters ahead of </p>
<p>time. You don’t want to have to figure out what the </p>
<p>lich’s lair looks like on the fly, for example. And </p>
<p>you might want a few “random” encounters to fill </p>
<p>in the gaps between the heroes’ actions.</p>
<p>The.Genre</p>
<p>Your  setting  should  hint  at  what  genre  it’s </p>
<p>in—you  shouldn’t  pick  a  genre  and  then  try  to </p>
<p>shoehorn  your  setting  into  it.  Maybe  you  want </p>
<p>to make a pulp fantasy game that harkens back </p>
<p>to  the  old  Robert  E.  Howard <i> Conan®</i>  stories. </p>
<p>You  could  call  that  pulp,  but  most  people  will </p>
<p>think you’re talking about Indiana Jones® or <i>The </i></p>
<p><i>Shadow®.</i> Call it fantasy and they’ll think you’re </p>
<p>talking about Tolkien or <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons®.</i></p>
<p>So how about “pulp  fantasy?” That tells  your </p>
<p>friends that there’s not likely to be lots of shining </p>
<p>knights  on white horses  saving princesses. It’s </p>
<p>more likely to feature cunning rogues outwitting </p>
<p>incredibly powerful sorcerers, lost races, forgotten </p>
<p>ruins, and savage combat.</p>
<p>Having a genre description in your head can </p>
<p>go a long way toward helping you figure out what </p>
<p>kinds  of  villains  should  be  present,  and  what </p>
<p>typical adventures your characters might go on.</p>
<p>The.World</p>
<p>Now it’s time to design the world itself. Start with </p>
<p>the area you expect the heroes to adventure in </p>
<p>most of the time. If there’s a city that serves as </p>
<p>their  home  base,  describe  it  in  a  paragraph  or </p>
<p>two. Is it a shining example of law and order? Or </p>
<p>is it a wretched hive of scum and villainy? Now </p>
<p>sketch out some of the surrounding areas. Are </p>
<p>the “Mountains of Dread” just a few miles away? </p>
<p>Or are such places relatively far away from the </p>
<p>centers of population?</p>
<p>There are several software programs available </p>
<p>to  help  you  do  this  if  you  like. The  nice  thing </p>
<p>about using a computer program is that it’s much </p>
<p>easier to make changes should you later decide </p>
<p>the Mountains of Dread were just too close. Or </p>
<p>perhaps the players themselves can add to the </p>
<p>map in exploration campaigns as they discover </p>
<p>new areas and lost cities!</p>
<p>Original.Settings</p>
<p>When creating your own original setting, start </p>
<p>by  identifying  its  core  elements.  Spend  some </p>
<p>time writing down just what makes it so special. </p>
<p>What are the themes? Is it fantasy? Is it science </p>
<p>fiction? Is it science fantasy? Is there a hook? If </p>
<p>so, what is it? (And we highly recommend you </p>
<p>have  a  hook—there  are  already  solid  swords </p>
<p>and sorcery realms with elves and dwarves. Add </p>
<p>something new, like an alien invasion—as we did </p>
<p>in <i>Evernight</i>.) </p>
<p>Once you have clearly identified the thematic </p>
<p>elements that identify your setting, figure out who </p>
<p>the heroes are. These “archetypes” are usually </p>
<p>the best identifiers of new worlds. </p>
<p>Next  figure  out  what  kind  of  adventures  take </p>
<p>place. There’s  no  point  detailing  the  undersea </p>
<p>world  of  Caribdus,  for  example,  if  99%  of  the </p>
<p>action in <i>50 Fathoms</i> takes place above water and </p>
<p>on ships. Focus your efforts where it’s important, </p>
<p>then fill in the extra details when they come up. </p>
<p>The last step you should take is creating new </p>
<p>powers,  Edges,  and  Hindrances.  For  the  most </p>
<p>part,  we’ve  found  you  really  want  to  keep  the </p>
<p>selection to less than a dozen powers, and half </p>
<p>that number of new Edges or Hindrances. A lot of </p>
<p>new Game Masters go crazy creating scores of </p>
<p>each, but at the end of the day find that most of </p>
<p>the stuff people actually take is already covered </p>
<p>in the main <i>Savage Worlds</i> rule book. That’s not </p>
<p>to say you shouldn’t have some cool new powers, </p>
<p>Edges, or Hindrances—just that you should think </p>
<p>them through very carefully, and add them mostly </p>
<p>for flavor or to cover some very unique feature </p>
<p>of the setting that the rules don’t currently cover. </p>
<p>Converted.Settings.</p>
<p>There are literally thousands of great roleplaying </p>
<p>settings  out  there  made  by  other  companies </p>
<p>besides Pinnacle. We’re fans of many of these </p>
<p>brilliant worlds as well. But we usually like playing </p>
<p>them  with <i>Savage Worlds.</i>  Here  are  some tips </p>
<p>we’ve learned after a few years of watching folks </p>
<p>“savage” other games. </p>
<p>Don’t  reinvent  the  wheel. <i> Savage  Worlds</i> </p>
<p>was  designed  for  quick  play  with  minimal  rule </p>
<p>interference. All  too  often  conversions  of  other </p>
<p>games try to account for every element —massive </p>
<p>skill lists, minute details, and hundreds of powers. </p>
<p>This isn’t <i>Savage Worlds</i>, and bringing in those </p>
<p>elements is likely to burden the rules to the point </p>
<p>where the game play is no longer fast, furious, </p>
<p>or fun. </p>
<p>Like  an  original  setting,  identify  the  themes </p>
<p>of the other game and try to adapt with a very </p>
<p>few key world rules. Literal translations of game </p>
<p>mechanics from other systems usually just result </p>
<p>in cumbersome sub-systems that don’t add one </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--149</p>
<p>Game.Mastering</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--150</p>
<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p>minute of fun to the Savage version. </p>
<p>There is a often a strong desire to create lots of </p>
<p>new skills, Edges, and powers to fit your setting. </p>
<p>That’s  understandable,  but  it  isn’t  always  the </p>
<p>best path.</p>
<p>Remember  that  more  skills  dilutes  the  pool </p>
<p>from which the players can choose. It weakens </p>
<p>the overall character, because now their 15 skill </p>
<p>points have to be spread further. Creating a list of </p>
<p>20 different firearm skills might be more realistic, </p>
<p>but the system wasn’t designed that way and it </p>
<p>becomes a major burden to the players. Creating </p>
<p>one new Edge that allows a person to specialize </p>
<p>in a specific gun is a better way to go if that’s </p>
<p>particularly  important  to  the  feel  of  your  game </p>
<p>(as it might be in a high-tech military campaign). </p>
<p>Remember too that a lot of what you’re looking </p>
<p>for might already be in the rules. Do you need </p>
<p>a sniper Edge? That’s Marksman. Do you need </p>
<p>a Mechanic skill? Why not use Repair? Do you </p>
<p>need a magic missile power? Why not use <i>bolt</i>?</p>
<p>When you do decide to add a new skill, try to </p>
<p>let it cover as broad a range of related topics as </p>
<p>possible. There’s  no  need  to  create  Dancing, </p>
<p>Oratory, Acting,  and  Singing  Skills  in  most </p>
<p>campaigns when a single Perform skill does the </p>
<p>trick.</p>
<p>When converting monsters and Extras, compare </p>
<p>them to existing creatures in this rule book. That’s </p>
<p>much  easier—and  much  less  confining—than </p>
<p>trying to convert every attribute, skill, and hit point. </p>
<p>Design.Note.-.The.Elevator.Pitch</p>
<p><i>There’s a term used in Hollywood called </i></p>
<p><i>“the Elevator Pitch.” The idea is that you’re </i></p>
<p><i>a  young  and  hungry  screenwriter  trying  to </i></p>
<p><i>pitch an idea to an executive. You can’t get </i></p>
<p><i>in to see him, but one day he’s in the elevator </i></p>
<p><i>and you have about 30 seconds to make him </i></p>
<p><i>understand your idea, why it’s cool, and why </i></p>
<p><i>he’d want to make it.</i></p>
<p><i>The  idea  of  the  elevator  pitch  is  strong </i></p>
<p><i>for your campaign as well. If it takes many </i></p>
<p><i>minutes to explain what the game is about </i></p>
<p><i>to your potential players, it’s too much. You </i></p>
<p><i>can certainly do all the things you’ve talked </i></p>
<p><i>about or have them as part of your backstory, </i></p>
<p><i>but they need to be revealed during play as </i></p>
<p><i>they’re important to the characters.</i></p>
<p><i>If your game can be summed up succinctly, </i></p>
<p><i>the players will get it quickly as well. You’ll </i></p>
<p><i>also know very quickly if they’re excited about </i></p>
<p><i>it and then can ask you for the details they’re </i></p>
<p><i>particularly interested in.</i></p>
<p><i>Here are the elevator pitches for some of </i></p>
<p><i>Pinnacle’s games:</i></p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Deadlands:</b>  Weird  Western  horror  where </p>
<p>heroes  are  sometimes  so  tough  they  come </p>
<p>back from the dead.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>50 Fathoms:</b> A fantastic and colorful world is </p>
<p>drowning from a witch’s curse. Heroes from </p>
<p>that  world  and  our  own  earth  must  travel </p>
<p>the seas to stop the flooding and defeat the </p>
<p>witches.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Necessary Evil:</b> When all the superheroes are </p>
<p>gone, the only ones left to save the world from </p>
<p>an evil alien invasion are the supervillains!</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Weird Wars: </b>The violence of war gives rise </p>
<p>to dark things. Soldiers, sailors, and airmen of </p>
<p>every nation must battle their enemies as well </p>
<p>as the horrible things that grow in the shadows.</p>
<p>Races</p>
<p>A race of super-intelligent titans are simply going </p>
<p>to be more powerful in game terms than humans. </p>
<p>That’s  fine  if  everyone  is  playing  a  titan,  but  if </p>
<p>they’re not, the GM needs to do a little balancing.</p>
<p>Guidelines  for  creating  new  player  character </p>
<p>races can be found on page 22, but if the entire </p>
<p>campaign world is more difficult (or less difficult), </p>
<p>don’t  be  afraid  to  amp  up  (or  tone  down)  the </p>
<p>heroes.</p>
<p>Perhaps  the  player  characters  are  all  giant </p>
<p>monsters, as are their foes. Or perhaps the heroes </p>
<p>are  intelligent  rats.  Both  campaigns  could  be </p>
<p>extremely  interesting—and  require  stronger  or </p>
<p>weaker starting statistics.</p>
<p>New.Edges.&amp;.Hindrances</p>
<p>Now  comes  one  of  the  trickiest  parts  of  the </p>
<p>game. You may want to create some new Edges </p>
<p>&amp; Hindrances for your setting. First, realize that </p>
<p>you <i>probably</i> don’t have to. What’s in this book </p>
<p>covers an awful lot of character types.</p>
<p>What  you  really  may  want  to  look  at  are </p>
<p>Professional Edges. These help you create the </p>
<p>archetypal  characters  of  your  world. A <i> Savage </i></p>
<p><i>Worlds</i> character with the Woodsman Edge, for </p>
<p>example, is a “ranger” in most swords and sorcery </p>
<p>games.</p>
<p>If there’s a particular character type common to </p>
<p>your world, this is the way to encourage your group </p>
<p>to play them. Let’s say you’re creating a far-future </p>
<p><i>Matrix</i>-type  world  with  vampires,  for  example, </p>
<p>and you want to create one or more Professional </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--151</p>
<p>Game.Mastering</p>
<p>Edges for vampire hunters. You could start with </p>
<p>something useful but fairly low-powered, let’s call </p>
<p>it Hunter. These are guys who know the vampires </p>
<p>exist and have fought them before. Maybe their </p>
<p>special ability is that they never make Fear checks </p>
<p>when confronted by vampires. To reflect the fact </p>
<p>that they’ve had to face them before, you set the </p>
<p>requirement as Novice, Fighting d8+, and Spirit </p>
<p>of d8+.</p>
<p>Maybe  later  on,  you  create  Vampire  Hunter. </p>
<p>These  guys  have  learned  how  to  stake  the </p>
<p>bloodsuckers  in  the  heart,  and  halve  penalties </p>
<p>for such called shots. Maybe an improved version </p>
<p>negates the penalty altogether.</p>
<p>If  there’s  a  cardinal  rule  to  Edges,  it’s  that </p>
<p>you don’t want to grant flat bonuses to combat </p>
<p>or  arcane  skills.  It’s  okay  if  they  only  apply  in </p>
<p>certain situations, but don’t give gunslingers +2 </p>
<p>to Shooting all the time, or martial artists +2 to </p>
<p>Fighting  all  the  time. You’ll  really  throw  off  the </p>
<p>scale of the game if you do that, particularly as </p>
<p>they reach higher Ranks. You can give them flat </p>
<p>bonuses to noncombat skills, but be careful not </p>
<p>to stack them too high with those already found </p>
<p>in this book.</p>
<p>Finally, don’t feel you need a ton of new Edges </p>
<p>&amp; Hindrances. What you’re looking for is those </p>
<p>few bits that make the world stand out, or enable </p>
<p>a particular character archetype to function more </p>
<p>effectively than he could if the new rules weren’t </p>
<p>there. It’s not a good idea to go scouring every </p>
<p>other book we’ve done and import all the Combat </p>
<p>Edges into your world—it’s overwhelming to the </p>
<p>players, unnecessary, and moves the game away </p>
<p>from what it’s supposed to be: streamlined fun.</p>
<p>Design.Note.-.Less.Is.More</p>
<p><i>We’ve seen hundreds of new settings now, </i></p>
<p><i>both  those  which  have  been  published  by </i></p>
<p><i>fans and licensees as well as submissions </i></p>
<p><i>that have never gone public. One thing we </i></p>
<p><i>see way too much is the “everything and the </i></p>
<p><i>kitchen  sink”  approach.  It’s  overwhelming </i></p>
<p><i>and it just doesn’t make sense. Does your </i></p>
<p><i>Cthulhu-inspired 1920s campaign really need </i></p>
<p><i>all  the  Combat  Edges  from  Weird  Wars? </i></p>
<p><i>Does your expedition to Mars really need all </i></p>
<p><i>the Professional Edges from 50 Fathoms?</i></p>
<p><i>Sometimes less is more. Use the core book </i></p>
<p><i>and anything you just can’t live without. For </i></p>
<p><i>everything else, let the players decide if they </i></p>
<p><i>want it. Then you can allow it, or not.</i></p>
<p>Trim.the.Fat!</p>
<p>Now  that  you  have  your  theme  and  your </p>
<p>mechanics are in place, it’s time to go back and </p>
<p>get rid of the stuff that doesn’t fit or isn’t needed. </p>
<p>Does your fantasy setting really need elves and </p>
<p>dwarves?  Or  did  you  include  them  because </p>
<p>every  fantasy  setting  since <i> The  Hobbit®</i>  has </p>
<p>them? Would anything be lost by their removal? </p>
<p>Could something else take their place? Do you </p>
<p>really need those extensive computer rules in a </p>
<p>sci-fi setting? <i>Star Trek®</i> might need extensive </p>
<p>computer rules—<i>Star Wars®</i> does not. Even then, </p>
<p>a Knowledge (Computer Use) skill probably does </p>
<p>everything you need. </p>
<p>Final.Note</p>
<p>At all times, remember to keep it “FFF”—or Fast, </p>
<p>Furious, and Fun! All progress in creating a setting </p>
<p>should further the setting’s feel, but never at the </p>
<p>expense of FFF. These are some of the lessons </p>
<p>we think work for most people and most settings, </p>
<p>and have been echoed on our forums and listservs </p>
<p>since <i>Savage Worlds</i> came out in March of 2003. </p>
<p>But it’s your game, and you need to decide what </p>
<p>works best for you.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--152</p>
<p>We’ve  talked  about  heroes  and  their  antics. </p>
<p>Now it’s time to deal with the monsters, villains, </p>
<p>and bad guys. Below are some abilities common </p>
<p>to many monsters and villains.</p>
<p>Nonplayer characters and monsters can have </p>
<p>any regular Edges or Hindrances the GM feels </p>
<p>are  appropriate  and  are  not  made  like  player </p>
<p>characters. Just give them the abilities you want </p>
<p>them to have and spend your time and mental </p>
<p>energy on better things, like the plot of the game </p>
<p>or how best to entertain your group.</p>
<p>Monstrous.Abilities</p>
<p>Aquatic</p>
<p>The creature is native to the water. It is a natural </p>
<p>swimmer and cannot drown. While in the water, </p>
<p>its Pace is generally equal to its Swimming skill, </p>
<p>but some creatures (usually fish) may have much </p>
<p>higher movement rates.</p>
<p>Armor</p>
<p>A  creature’s Armor  adds  to  the  creature’s </p>
<p>Toughness  (already  added  in  to  its  statistics), </p>
<p>usually  in  all  locations.  Thick,  leathery  hide </p>
<p>generally  offers  2  points  of Armor.  “Armored” </p>
<p>creatures like a stegosaurus generally have 4 or </p>
<p>more points of protection. Supernatural creatures </p>
<p>may  have  much  higher Armor  values. A  living </p>
<p>statue, for example, might have 8 points of Armor </p>
<p>or more.</p>
<p>Burrowing</p>
<p>From  massive  worms  to  sand-dwelling </p>
<p>humanoids, many creatures are able to burrow </p>
<p>beneath  the  earth  and  move  within  it.  These </p>
<p>creatures can tunnel underground and reappear </p>
<p>elsewhere for devastating surprise attacks against </p>
<p>their foes. The distance a creature can burrow in a </p>
<p>turn is written immediately after its Burrow ability. </p>
<p>A  burrowing  creature  may  tunnel  on  its  action, </p>
<p>and may erupt from the ground at any point within </p>
<p>its burrowing Pace the same round if desired. It </p>
<p>cannot be attacked while beneath the earth unless </p>
<p>the attacker has some special means of detecting </p>
<p>it and penetrating the intervening dirt.</p>
<p>Burrowing  creatures  strike  by  erupting  from </p>
<p>beneath  their  opponents  and  taking  them  by </p>
<p>surprise.  When  this  occurs,  the  Burrowing </p>
<p>creature makes an opposed Stealth roll versus </p>
<p>the target’s Notice. If the creature wins, it gains +2 </p>
<p>to attack and damage that round, or +4 if it gets a </p>
<p>raise. If the victim wins and was on Hold, he may </p>
<p>try to interrupt the burrower’s attack as usual.</p>
<p>Construct</p>
<p>Robots,  golems,  and  other  animated  objects </p>
<p>are  collectively  called  “constructs.”  Some  are </p>
<p>sentient beings while others are mere automatons </p>
<p>following the will of a hidden master.</p>
<p>Whatever their origin or material, such beings </p>
<p>have several inherent advantages over creatures </p>
<p>of flesh and blood:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Constructs  add  +2  when  attempting  to </p>
<p>recover from being Shaken.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Constructs do not suffer additional damage </p>
<p>from called shots (unless otherwise specified </p>
<p>in their description).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Construct  Wild  Cards  never  suffer  from </p>
<p>Wound Modifiers.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Constructs  do  not  suffer  from  disease  or </p>
<p>poison.</p>
<p>Elemental</p>
<p>Air,  earth,  fire,  and  water  form  the  basis  of </p>
<p>the  elemental  realms,  wherein  dwell  strange, </p>
<p>unfathomable creatures.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Elementals suffer no additional damage from </p>
<p>called shots.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Elementals are Fearless.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Elemental  Wild  Cards  never  suffer  from </p>
<p>Wound Modifiers.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Elementals  do  not  suffer  from  disease  or </p>
<p>poison.</p>
<p>Ethereal</p>
<p>Ghosts, shadows, will-o’-the-wisps, and similar </p>
<p>intangible creatures have no form in the physical </p>
<p>world  (or  can  turn  it  on  and  off  at  will). They </p>
<p>cannot be harmed by physical attacks, and cannot </p>
<p>Chapter.Seven:.</p>
<p>Bestiary</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--153</p>
<p>even be seen unless they desire to be. Ethereal </p>
<p>creatures are always affected by magical items, </p>
<p>weapons, and supernatural powers.</p>
<p>Most ethereal creatures can still affect things </p>
<p>in the physical world—throwing objects, wielding </p>
<p>ghostly  swords,  or  even  pushing  heroes  down </p>
<p>long, dark stairs.</p>
<p>Fear</p>
<p>Particularly  frightening  monsters  cause  Fear </p>
<p>checks to all who see them. Some truly terrifying </p>
<p>monsters may inflict penalties on Fear checks as </p>
<p>well. A creature with Fear –2, for instance, causes </p>
<p>those who see it to make their Fear checks at –2. </p>
<p>See the <b>Fear </b>rules on page 97 for effects.</p>
<p>Fearless</p>
<p>Mindless creatures, some undead, robots, and </p>
<p>the like don’t suffer from the weaknesses of the </p>
<p>mortal mind. Fearless creatures never suffer from </p>
<p>Fear effects and cannot be affected by Intimidation </p>
<p>(though Taunt may still work).</p>
<p>Flight</p>
<p>The  creature  can  fly  at  the  listed  Pace  and </p>
<p>ignores the effects of difficult ground. The flyer </p>
<p>also  has  a  Climb  score  that  reflects  its  in-air </p>
<p>maneuverability. The number is entirely relative </p>
<p>and is mostly used for Chases to determine if the </p>
<p>beast is more maneuverable than its foes (see </p>
<p>page 94).</p>
<p>Gargantuan</p>
<p>Gargantuan  creatures  are  those  that  are  at </p>
<p>least  size  9  or  better.  Classic  movie  monsters </p>
<p>like <i>Godzilla</i> or <i>King Kong</i> fit into this category. </p>
<p>Gargantuans have Heavy Armor, so they can only </p>
<p>be hurt by Heavy Weapons, and all their attacks </p>
<p>count as Heavy Weapons as well.</p>
<p>Gargantuans suffer the penalty for being Huge: </p>
<p>+4 to attack rolls from man-sized creatures.</p>
<p>When a Gargantuan creature makes a stomp </p>
<p>attack (Game Master’s call), add its Size to its </p>
<p>damage roll, but subtract the Size of the foe as </p>
<p>well. Don’t add the size of inanimate obstacles </p>
<p>such  as  vehicles,  buildings,  or  ships—that’s </p>
<p>already figured into their Toughness.</p>
<p>Hardy</p>
<p>Very  tough  and  resilient  creatures  do  not  fall </p>
<p>from lesser wounds, no matter how many they </p>
<p>suffer. A decisive blow is needed to put one of </p>
<p>these tenacious creatures down.</p>
<p>If the beast is Shaken, further Shaken results </p>
<p>have  no  further  effect—they  do  not  cause  a </p>
<p>wound.</p>
<p>Infection</p>
<p>A vampire’s bite, a horrid spider-like creature </p>
<p>that  injects  eggs  into  its  victim’s  wounds,  or </p>
<p>even the disease-born scratching of rats are all </p>
<p>examples of Infection.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--154</p>
<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p>Whenever a character is Shaken or wounded </p>
<p>by a creature with Infection, the victim must make </p>
<p>a Vigor roll. Modifiers to the roll are listed in the </p>
<p>creature’s description, as are the effects of failure.</p>
<p>Infravision</p>
<p>Nocturnal  beasts  often  see  in  the  infrared </p>
<p>spectrum—meaning they can “see” by detecting </p>
<p>heat. Creatures with Infravision halve penalties </p>
<p>(round  down)  for  bad  lighting  when  attacking </p>
<p>living targets.</p>
<p> Clever characters may figure out ways to mask </p>
<p>their heat from such creatures. Smearing cold mud </p>
<p>over one’s body or wearing special heat-filtering </p>
<p>suits  generally  obscures  the  target  from  those </p>
<p>with Infravision. Creatures with Infravision almost </p>
<p>always have normal sight as well.</p>
<p>Immunity</p>
<p>Creatures born in fire aren’t affected by heat, </p>
<p>and a horror made of pure lightning won’t suffer </p>
<p>from a <i>bolt</i> attack with an electrical trapping.</p>
<p>Immunities  are  always  to  specific  types  of </p>
<p>attacks, such as fire, cold, electricity, and so on. </p>
<p>Such  creatures  aren’t  Invulnerable,  they  just </p>
<p>ignore  damage  from  the  specific  attack  types </p>
<p>named.</p>
<p>Invulnerability</p>
<p>Savage Settings<b> </b>are filled with violent combat, </p>
<p>but many often feature desperate puzzle-solving </p>
<p>or dark research into unholy horrors as well. To </p>
<p>defeat  an  Invulnerable  creature,  you’ll  need  a </p>
<p>little of both.</p>
<p>Invulnerable creatures can be Shaken, but they </p>
<p>can’t be wounded by anything but their Weakness </p>
<p>(all such creatures have at least one if not more). </p>
<p>An  ancient  dark  god  given  life  by  misguided </p>
<p>cultists, for example, might be immune to mortal </p>
<p>weapons, but is vulnerable to shards of stained </p>
<p>glass gathered from a church.</p>
<p>Low.Light.Vision</p>
<p>Many monsters, and even fantasy races such as </p>
<p>elves and dwarves, are typically able to see in all </p>
<p>but the blackest darkness. Low light vision ignores </p>
<p>penalties for Dim and Dark lighting, allowing the </p>
<p>creature to see in all but pitch black conditions.</p>
<p>Paralysis</p>
<p>Certain  creatures  and  poisons  can  instantly </p>
<p>paralyze  a  foe,  rendering  the  victim  easy  prey </p>
<p>for the thing’s dark designs or ravenous appetite. </p>
<p>A target who suffers damage or a Shaken result </p>
<p>from such a creature must make a Vigor roll or </p>
<p>be paralyzed and incapable of any action—even </p>
<p>speech—for 2d6 rounds or longer.</p>
<p>Poison</p>
<p>Snakes,  venom-coated  daggers,  and  so  on </p>
<p>afflict their victims with dangerous poison. Poisons </p>
<p>are  described  in  more  detail  in  the <b> Hazards</b> </p>
<p>section.</p>
<p>A creature with the Poison ability typically injects </p>
<p>it via a bite or scratch. To do so, the thing must </p>
<p>cause at least a Shaken result to the victim, who </p>
<p>then makes a Vigor roll modified by the strength </p>
<p>of  the  poison  (listed  in  parentheses  after  the </p>
<p>creature’s Poison ability). The effects of failure are </p>
<p>described in each creature’s description.</p>
<p>Regeneration</p>
<p>Legend  has  it  that  trolls,  vampires,  and </p>
<p>certain  other  types  of  legendary  creatures  can </p>
<p>Regenerate damage caused to them.</p>
<p>Regeneration  comes  in  two  types:  Fast  and </p>
<p>Slow.</p>
<p>• Fast  Regeneration  lets  a  wounded  creature </p>
<p>make  a  Vigor  roll  every  round  to  heal  any </p>
<p>damage it has sustained—even after it has been </p>
<p>“killed.” A success heals one wound (or removes </p>
<p>Incapacitated  status),  and  a  raise  heals  an </p>
<p>additional wound. Most creatures with this ability </p>
<p>also have a Weakness or Vulnerability, such as </p>
<p>fire. Wounds from the creature’s Weakness or </p>
<p>Vulnerability  do  not  regenerate,  but  may  still </p>
<p>heal naturally. Creatures with Fast Regeneration </p>
<p>also add +2 to Spirit rolls made to recover from </p>
<p>being Shaken.</p>
<p>• Slow Regeneration means the creature won’t be </p>
<p>suddenly healing itself during a fight, but may </p>
<p>recover its wounds quickly between encounters. </p>
<p>Slow regenerators make a natural Healing roll </p>
<p>once per day.</p>
<p>Size</p>
<p>A creature’s size has a lot to do with how much </p>
<p>damage it can take, so we add a modifier to its </p>
<p>Toughness to reflect its tremendous mass. Note </p>
<p>that a beast’s size has nothing to do with Vigor—</p>
<p>even a mighty kraken can catch a cold or tire out.</p>
<p>The Toughness  modifiers  on  the  table  below </p>
<p>represent average specimens of particular species </p>
<p>for comparison, but there are always exceptions. </p>
<p>Not every great white has a +4 Toughness bonus. </p>
<p>A young specimen might have a +3, while a larger </p>
<p>fish might be +5 or even +6. The same is true for </p>
<p>humans. Small humans suffer a –1 penalty, while </p>
<p>those  with  the  Brawny  Edge  gain  a  +1  bonus. </p>
<p>Use the table as a baseline when creating your </p>
<p>own creatures then adjust for particularly large or </p>
<p>smaller versions.</p>

<p><b>Minimum  Toughness:</b>  Normal  creatures </p>
<p>have  a  minimum  Toughness  of  2  regardless </p>
<p>of  modifiers.  Only  insects  and  the  like  have </p>
<p>Toughness scores of 1.</p>
<p>Small/Large/Huge</p>
<p>Creatures  the  size  of  rats  or  pixies  are  very </p>
<p>difficult to hit, especially when moving. Assuming </p>
<p>such a creature is active, attackers subtract 2 from </p>
<p>any attack rolls directed at it.</p>
<p>Large creatures, at least the size of a rhino, are </p>
<p>somewhat easier to hit. Attackers may add +2 to </p>
<p>any attack rolls directed at Large targets. Truly </p>
<p>Huge creatures, at least as big as a dragon, are </p>
<p>+4 to be hit.</p>
<p>This  ability  is  both  cumulative  and  relative, </p>
<p>meaning  the  inverse  of  the  modifier  applies  to </p>
<p>attacks made <i>by</i> the creature. So if an elephant </p>
<p>strikes at a human, it subtracts 2 from its roll, but </p>
<p>if attacking another elephant, the modifiers negate </p>
<p>each other.</p>
<p>Strength</p>
<p>Strength  is  a Trait,  not  a  special  ability,  but </p>
<p>because very large creatures exceed the normal </p>
<p>human  range  of  d4  to  d12,  you  might  need  a </p>
<p>little  more  information  when  creating  your  own </p>
<p>creatures.</p>
<p>Creatures of human or lesser Strength should </p>
<p>be expressed as a d4 through a d12, as you think </p>
<p>appropriate. Stronger creatures, such as gorillas, </p>
<p>ogres, and so on, have a d12 plus a bonus. The </p>
<p>bonus depends on how strong the creature is and </p>
<p>how well it can use that strength in combat. Just </p>
<p>as  with  humans,  there  is  variation  within  each </p>
<p>species, however. A mother gorilla may have a </p>
<p>Strength of d12+1, while her much larger mate </p>
<p>has a Strength of d12+3.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick comparison to help you figure </p>
<p>out what Strength creatures of your own creation </p>
<p>should have.</p>
<p>Creature.Strength</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>Creature </b></p>
<p><b>Strength</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Gorilla, bear, ogre </p>
<p>d12+1 to +3</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rhino, great white </p>
<p>d12+3 to +6</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Elephant, drake, T-Rex </p>
<p>d12+5 to +8</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dragon </p>
<p>d12+9 to +12</p>
<p>Stun</p>
<p>A creature with this ability often has an electrical </p>
<p>attack, mild toxin, mind lash, or similar trapping. </p>
<p>When it successfully hits a character (even if it </p>
<p>causes no damage), the victim must make a Vigor </p>
<p>roll minus any listed penalties or be Shaken. He </p>
<p>cannot attempt to recover from being Shaken for </p>
<p>1d6 rounds.</p>
<p>Undead</p>
<p>Zombies, skeletons, and similar Undead horrors </p>
<p>are particularly difficult to destroy. Below are the </p>
<p>benefits of being such an abomination.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Undead add +2 to their basic Toughness.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Undead add +2 when attempting to recover </p>
<p>from being Shaken.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Undead don’t suffer additional damage from </p>
<p>called shots.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Undead Wild Cards never suffer from Wound </p>
<p>Modifiers.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Undead do not suffer from disease or poison.</p>
<p>Wall.Walker</p>
<p>Some creatures have the ability to walk on walls. </p>
<p>These creatures only make Climbing rolls in the </p>
<p>most adverse and stressful situations—otherwise </p>
<p>they  automatically  walk  on  vertical  or  inverted </p>
<p>surfaces just as a human walks on the earth.</p>
<p>A Wall Walker’s Pace when walking on walls </p>
<p>is  its  standard  movement  rate.  It  may  run  as </p>
<p>usual when walking on walls unless the specific </p>
<p>creature’s text says otherwise.</p>
<p>Weakness</p>
<p>Some  creatures  suffer  additional  damage  or </p>
<p>other effects when attacked by their Weakness. </p>
<p>A creature made of ice, for example, might take </p>
<p>double damage from fire. A vampire suffers from </p>
<p>a Weakness to sunlight, causing it to catch fire </p>
<p>and burn when exposed to its rays.</p>
<p>See the creature’s description for the particular </p>
<p>effects of its Weakness.</p>
<p>Some  creatures  can  only  be  killed  by  their </p>
<p>Weakness. They may feel pain or even become </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--156</p>
<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p>Shaken from other attack types, but only suffer </p>
<p>wounds  when  struck  by  their  Weakness. A </p>
<p>vampire,  for  instance,  ignores  wounds  from </p>
<p>swords and bullets, but suffers damage normally </p>
<p>if hit in the heart with a wooden stake.</p>
<p>Bestiary</p>
<p>Below is a sampling of some common animals </p>
<p>and monsters common to many Savage Settings. </p>
<p>Note  that  for  some  creatures,  Smarts  is  listed </p>
<p>relative to the animal world, and is thus followed by </p>
<p>an (A) to remind you that this is animal intelligence, </p>
<p>not people intelligence, so don’t expect a dolphin </p>
<p>to drive off in your tank just because it’s a <i>relatively</i> </p>
<p>smart animal. Creatures with animal intelligence </p>
<p>do  not  typically Advance  as Allies—this  only </p>
<p>happens if the animal is gained via an Edge.</p>
<p>Alligator/Crocodile</p>
<p>Alligators  and  crocs  are </p>
<p>staples  of  most  pulp-genre </p>

<p>Minotaur</p>
<p>Minotaurs stand over 7’ tall and </p>

<p>from  biting  ants  to  stinging </p>

<p>Toughness of these smaller swarms is lowered </p>
<p>by –2 (to 5 each).</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Swarm:</b>  Parry  +2;  Because  the  swarm  is </p>
<p>composed of scores, hundreds, or thousands </p>
<p>of creatures, cutting and piercing weapons do </p>
<p>no  real  damage. Area-effect  weapons  work </p>
<p>normally, and a character can stomp to inflict </p>
<p>his damage in Strength each round. Swarms </p>
<p>are usually foiled by jumping in water (unless </p>
<p>they are aquatic pests, such as piranha).</p>
<p>Troll</p>
<p>Trolls  in  myths  and  legends </p>
<p>are  horrid,  flesh-eating </p>
<p>creatures  who  live  in  deep </p>
<p>woods,  beneath  bridges,  or </p>
<p>in  hidden  mountain  caves. </p>
<p>In modern games and fiction, </p>
<p>trolls are monsters with the ability </p>

<p>Knight.Errant:.Return.Engagement</p>
<p>Something  has  awakened  at  the  Orpheum, </p>
<p>an  old  building  that  has  been  everything  from </p>
<p>a theatre to a  slaughterhouse. The  heroes  are </p>
<p>employees of Knight Errant, a detective agency </p>
<p>that specializes in the macabre—and has a very </p>
<p>high turnover rate…</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Setting  Rules:</b>  Critical  Failures,  Gritty </p>
<p>Damage</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Characters:</b>  The  heroes  are  investigators </p>
<p>working with the Knight Errant Detective Agency.</p>
<p>The investigators have been sent to look into the </p>
<p>renovation of the Orpheum Theatre in a decaying </p>
<p>area of a nearby city’s downtown. The work has </p>
<p>suffered a number of unexplained setbacks and </p>
<p>the  company  insuring  the  project  has  come  to </p>
<p>suspect that the owner of the theater, Silas Linden, </p>
<p>is deliberately sabotaging the effort in an attempt </p>
<p>at  insurance  fraud.  The  insurance  company </p>
<p>has hired Knight Errant to look into these grave </p>
<p>matters.</p>
<p>In reality, the construction crew has disturbed </p>
<p>a vampire that has lain in a comatose state for </p>
<p>over  half  a  century.  It  was  unwittingly  brought </p>
<p>to the theater as a display in a freak show and </p>
<p>abandoned  in  the  basement  when  the  theater </p>
<p>closed.</p>
<p>The monster was once a poor Chinese railroad </p>
<p>worker who fell victim to another such fiend long </p>
<p>ago. It speaks no English, and in fact is far too </p>
<p>mentally disturbed at this point to speak at all. </p>
<p>It stirred briefly when the building was used as </p>
<p>a  slaughterhouse,  feeding  on  the  blood  of  the </p>
<p>animals that drained down to it only to once again </p>
<p>lapse into torpor when that business closed as </p>
<p>well. The thing was awakened recently by a tragic </p>
<p>accident involving one of the workers.</p>
<p>Visiting.the.Orpheum</p>
<p>The Orpheum is an old building in a rundown </p>
<p>section of the city. Most of the buildings nearby are </p>
<p>abandoned and in poor repair. The theater, thanks </p>
<p>to its renovations, stands out like a diamond in </p>
<p>a coal pile. Inside, ornate filigree, marble tiling, </p>
<p>and generous use of opulent red curtains ooze a </p>
<p>sense of nostalgia for an earlier, more stylish time. </p>
<p>Meeting.Linden</p>
<p>The investigators find Linden, a short, somewhat </p>
<p>heavy-set  man,  very  receptive  to  their  arrival. </p>
<p>Linden  seems  genuinely  concerned  about  the </p>
<p>delays  his  project  has  suffered. A  number  of </p>
<p>workmen have been injured since the job started </p>
<p>Sample.Adventures</p>
<p>On the following pages are a number of “One </p>
<p>Sheet” adventures. You’ll find dozens more on our </p>
<p>website at www.peginc.com.</p>
<p>Why “One Sheet?” Our goal is to give a Game </p>
<p>Master something he can read, understand, and </p>
<p>be ready to run in just a few minutes—hence one </p>
<p>page (front and back) adventures.</p>
<p>Players can make characters appropriate for the </p>
<p>genre (or use the Archetypes on page 18–19) and </p>
<p>be ready to play in minutes as well.</p>
<p>One Sheets also demonstrate what we mean </p>
<p>by “Fast! Furious! Fun!” We get right to the most </p>
<p>important aspects of the adventure—the setup, </p>
<p>what  is  expected  to  happen,  and  the  statistics </p>
<p>for any monsters or villains the heroes are likely </p>
<p>to fight.</p>
<p>You won’t find details on the surroundings or </p>
<p>statistics  for  nonplayer  characters  who  aren’t </p>
<p>directly important to the plot. Those are left for you, </p>
<p>the Game Master, to make up as you go and as </p>
<p>they become important to your session.</p>
<p>If you’re not comfortable filling in the blanks, look </p>
<p>for full-length adventures on our website. Those </p>
<p>are generally designed for multiple sessions and </p>
<p>give  far  more  detail  on  the </p>

<p>Adventures</p>
<p>and rumors are beginning to circulate amongst the </p>
<p>men that the building is either haunted or cursed. A </p>
<p>few have apparently been so spooked they simply </p>
<p>walked off the job and never returned.</p>
<p>He answers any of their questions to the best </p>
<p>of  his  ability.  Linden  also  provides  them  with </p>
<p>unfettered access to the theater while the work </p>
<p>progresses, warning them that it is a construction </p>
<p>site  and  the  project  has  been  plagued  by  no </p>
<p>shortage of accidents.</p>
<p>A.Little.History</p>
<p>If asked, Linden tells the heroes the Orpheum </p>
<p>began as a theater back at the turn of the 20</p>
<p>th</p>
<p> </p>
<p>century, but closed its doors in the early 1920s. </p>
<p>The building was converted to a slaughterhouse </p>
<p>during  the  Depression,  however  that  business </p>
<p>folded around the time of the second World War. </p>
<p>Much of the renovation has involved removing and </p>
<p>repairing modifications made during the building’s </p>
<p>time as a slaughterhouse.</p>
<p>It has sat unused and unoccupied since then—</p>
<p>except, he adds, for the usual transients and drug </p>
<p>addicts. Linden admits he never actually saw any </p>
<p>in the theater, but the neighborhood was overrun </p>
<p>with shady characters. Now, most seem to have </p>
<p>moved to less active areas in the city.</p>
<p>Legwork</p>
<p>Depending  on  how  they  approach  the </p>
<p>investigation,  the  characters  can  discover  a </p>
<p>number  of  clues.  Reveal  the  information  as </p>
<p>the  team  investigates  the  theater  and  the </p>
<p>neighborhood. Let them ask questions and think </p>
<p>about how to get these clues—don’t just give them </p>
<p>info based on skill rolls.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Accidents: </b>The first accident occurred while </p>
<p>the crew was removing the old slaughterhouse </p>
<p>equipment. One of the men nearly severed an </p>
<p>arm on a rusty saw and bled out before the </p>
<p>ambulance arrived.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Basement: </b>The lower level is a cluttered mess </p>
<p>of boxes, crates, and furniture forming a virtual </p>
<p>maze. A prop elevator sits at the stage end </p>
<p>and a large area has been cleared around a </p>
<p>floor drain under the old orchestra pit. There </p>
<p>are  deep  red  stains  around  the  drain—left </p>
<p>over from the slaughterhouse blood sluices. </p>
<p>A  Notice  roll  spots  recent  scrapes  around </p>
<p>the drain cover, indicating it may have been </p>
<p>moved.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Financial Ledger: </b>Any investigator scouring </p>
<p>Linden’s  financial  records  can  make  an </p>
<p>Investigation or Knowledge (Accounting) roll. </p>
<p>Success finds that the man is so far in debt </p>
<p>on  the  project  that  even  if  he  defaults  and </p>
<p>collects the insurance, he will have to declare </p>
<p>bankruptcy.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Missing Workers: </b>None of the crew has heard </p>
<p>from any of the other workers who left the site. </p>
<p>In fact, in many cases, no one ever saw them </p>
<p>leave. A Streetwise roll finds that most of the </p>
<p>missing crewmen had been assigned to work </p>
<p>clearing the basement level. </p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Neighborhood: </b> A  Streetwise  roll  discovers </p>
<p>that most of the former homeless inhabitants </p>
<p>of  the  area  left  not  because  of  the  work  at </p>
<p>the  Orpheum. The  few  who  remain  tell  the </p>
<p>investigators  that  “something  woke  up”  in </p>
<p>the Orpheum and it preys on anyone foolish </p>
<p>enough to be caught alone at night.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Newspaper Reports: </b>An Investigation roll on </p>
<p>recent  newspaper  articles  finds  that  shortly </p>
<p>after  the  first  accident  at  the  Orpheum,  a </p>
<p>homeless man was found dead not far from </p>
<p>the theater. The cause of death was massive </p>
<p>blood loss.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Orpheum Records: </b>The records from the first </p>
<p>Orpheum are intact, buried in the basement. </p>
<p>The original theater turned to displays of the </p>
<p>unusual  or  macabre  toward  the  end  of  its </p>
<p>run in an attempt to keep its doors open. An </p>
<p>Investigation  roll  uncovers  the  last  display </p>
<p>was purchased from “Nightlinger’s Traveling </p>
<p>Expedition of the Extraordinary” and included, </p>
<p>among other things, “one coffin and contents.”</p>
<p>The.Final.Act</p>
<p>The vampire has created a few offspring from </p>
<p>workers and homeless victims during its recent </p>
<p>feedings. The creatures hide in the sewers under </p>
<p>the theater, crawling up through the drain mainly </p>
<p>at night. Rarely, they may snatch a lone worker </p>
<p>from the basement during the day.</p>
<p>If the investigators enter the sewers, the undead </p>
<p>immediately attack. Should they set up watch on </p>
<p>the theater during the night hours to catch vandals </p>
<p>or saboteurs, whether inside or out, allow them </p>
<p>Notice rolls to spot the monsters creeping out to </p>
<p>seek prey. </p>
<p>The young vampires, driven by bloodlust, are </p>
<p>feral and fight to the death. The ancient vampire </p>
<p>tries to flee if it suffers two Wounds, attempting to </p>
<p>escape into the sewers under the theater.</p>

<p>To the south are ice-laden seas. To the east and </p>
<p>west are rival clans. To the north are tall mountains </p>
<p>said to be home to fierce trolls and massive packs </p>
<p>of hungry wolves. It is the trolls that pose the most </p>
<p>recent threat to Trundheim.</p>
<p>Two nights ago trolls descended into the village </p>
<p>and took one of the village’s most beautiful girls—</p>
<p>the Jarl’s daughter, Brynhilde. The warriors are </p>
<p>tasked with venturing out during one of the worst </p>
<p>blizzards the elders can remember to bring her </p>
<p>back—or avenge her death with the heads of the </p>
<p>mysterious trolls.</p>
<p>The.Ice.Trolls</p>
<p>The adventure starts in the small hours of dawn. </p>
<p>Sven Sjurson, who was on guard duty the last </p>
<p>part of the night, wakes the village with a cry. He </p>
<p>is covered in blood and suffers from a nasty blow </p>
<p>to the head. Nearby is the home of Jarl Steinar, </p>
<p>headman of the village. The log wall of the longhall </p>
<p>has been pulled down and the jarl lies dead in a </p>
<p>pool of frozen gore. Sven tells the following tale:</p>
<p><i>Something  terrible  came  through  the </i></p>
<p><i>darkness. I turned to fight but the thing was </i></p>
<p><i>so tall it blocked out the moon! I was about </i></p>
<p><i>to strike when it swung a massive club at my </i></p>
<p><i>head. The next thing I know I was lying in </i></p>
<p><i>the snow here and…Jarl Steinar was dead.</i></p>
<p>The  Jarl is a  bloody mess. Long claw marks </p>
<p>cover his body, and it appears the death blow was </p>
<p>delivered to his throat. A quick search of the rest of </p>
<p>the longhall reveals the Jarl’s daughter, Brynhilde, </p>
<p>is missing—her bed violently overturned and furs </p>
<p>strewn about the floor. If anyone thinks to look, the </p>
<p>Jarl’s few valuables are still present.</p>
<p>In  the  nearby  snow  are  massive  barefoot </p>
<p>tracks—the feet at least a foot and a half long. </p>
<p>Farther out the tracks vanish—a fierce snow is </p>
<p>setting in and covering them quickly.</p>
<p>The clan is without leadership, but if the heroes </p>
<p>don’t  think  of  it  on  their  own,  the  town  elders </p>
<p>strongly encourage them to form a rescue party </p>
<p>and set out immediately. The rest of the warriors </p>
<p>will need to stay in town to prevent further raids </p>
<p>and to protect against opportunistic rival clans to </p>
<p>the east and west.</p>
<p>The tracks are fading fast, but they lead to the </p>
<p>mountainous  north. A Tracking  roll  points  the </p>
<p>rescue party in the right direction. A raise on the </p>
<p>Tracking roll reveals there are three distinct sets </p>
<p>of tracks.</p>
<p>What.Really.Happened</p>
<p>Bjorn Thorkellson is the Jarl of the nearby village </p>
<p>of Aldavig. He desperately wants the favor of the </p>
<p>king, but to do so he must expand his control to </p>
<p>more than a single settlement. Trundheim is small </p>
<p>but rich thanks to particularly successful raids the </p>
<p>last few years. Fighting such successful warriors </p>
<p>would be difficult and likely destroy much of the </p>
<p>village, so Thorkellson came up with a more subtle </p>
<p>plan. He gathered a group of his most veteran </p>
<p>warriors and tasked them with feigning an attack </p>
<p>by a monster on the village, killing Jarl Steinar </p>
<p>in  his  sleep,  and  kidnapping  his  daughter.  His </p>
<p>own  hunting  band  would  then  “chance”  across </p>
<p>the  beasts,  kill  them,  and  return  as  heroes  to </p>
<p>Trundheim with the princess. Thorkellson would </p>
<p>be  the  new  Jarl,  and  with  luck,  a  legend  sung </p>
<p>about by the skalds for ages to come for killing </p>
<p>the terrible trolls.</p>
<p>Thorkellson has an ally in the treacherous Sven </p>
<p>the Sjurson, who has been promised land in the </p>
<p>new fiefdom. Sven and the raiders killed the Jarl in </p>
<p>his sleep and knocked his daughter unconscious </p>
<p>(the Jarl’s wife died long ago). Then they quietly </p>
<p>tore down the walls and bashed Sven over the </p>
<p>head before stealing off into the howling storm.</p>
<p>Following.the.Raiders</p>
<p>The  kidnappers  have  headed  due  north. A </p>
<p>Tracking roll at –4 for the gathering snow leads </p>
<p>the rescuers quickly to their trail. If the roll is failed, </p>
<p>the group must make a Vigor roll to resist the cold </p>
<p>and  try  again.  If  the  party  decides  to  stop  and </p>
<p>recover (mandatory if one of the heroes becomes </p>
<p>Incapacitated),  they  must  build  a  temporary </p>
<p>shelter and bundle up. Every 30 minutes in the </p>
<p>shelter removes one level of Fatigue.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--170</p>
<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p>Pack.Tactics</p>
<p>After about half-a-day’s journey north the group </p>
<p>comes to the foothills. The blizzard picks up and </p>
<p>the  scattered  trees  are  leafless  and  bare. As </p>
<p>the rescuers pick their way through the blasted </p>
<p>landscape they hear sudden barking from behind. </p>
<p>Two  black  wolves  stand  out  against  the  snow </p>
<p>field. Unless the characters specifically state they </p>
<p>are not turning to look at the predators they are </p>
<p>ambushed by the rest of the pack hiding behind </p>
<p>scrub-covered hills to their front.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Wolf Pack (6):</b> See Wolves on page 157.</p>
<p>After the fight, the vikings can skin the wolves </p>
<p>for fur and meat. If they do so, this extra layer of </p>
<p>warmth  and  fresh  food  grants  them  +1  to  their </p>
<p>Vigor  rolls  versus  Fatigue  for  the  rest  of  the </p>
<p>adventure.</p>
<p>As they go about the bloody task, have the group </p>
<p>make Notice rolls. Whoever rolls highest finds a </p>
<p>scrap of red cloth on one of the scraggly trees. It </p>
<p>is the rich cloth of a chief’s daughter—Brynhilde.</p>
<p>Icy.Cliffs</p>
<p>By now all traces of the trolls’ footprints are lost, </p>
<p>but legend says the trolls live in the caves higher </p>
<p>in the mountains. To get to those caves the party </p>
<p>must climb a series of sheer cliffs. </p>
<p>Have the group make three Climbing rolls. The </p>
<p>rolls are made at –2 if the party had to find shelter </p>
<p>after leaving the village as the blizzard has grown </p>
<p>in intensity. </p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Total of 1 or less:</b> The character falls for 2d6 </p>
<p>damage if failed on the first roll, 3d6 on the </p>
<p>second, and 4d6 on the third.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Failure:</b> The character suffers a Fatigue level.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Success:</b> The climber ascends this section of </p>
<p>the mountain.</p>
<p>After each of the three ascents the heroes must </p>
<p>rest. Pick a character at random and draw a card </p>
<p>for an Interlude. Give the player a few minutes to </p>
<p>tell his tale, then move on to the next roll, or the </p>
<p>next scene if it was the third Interlude.</p>
<p>The.Trolls</p>
<p>After the grueling ascent, have everyone make </p>
<p>Notice rolls. The highest roll spots smoke coming </p>
<p>from somewhere in the mountains. With a Survival </p>
<p>roll the rescuers  find  the  cave quickly. If failed, </p>
<p>the  group  must  make  a  Vigor  roll  at  –2  before </p>
<p>stumbling upon the troll’s lair.</p>
<p>The  “trolls”  wait  with  the  captive  Brynhilde </p>
<p>beyond a bend in the cave. They have a warm </p>
<p>fire  and  stocks  of  meat  and  mead. Assuming </p>
<p>the rescuers approach quietly, they overhear the </p>
<p>raiders talking to their victim.</p>
<p><i>A heavy voice says: “You were taken by </i></p>
<p><i>trolls, girl. Say otherwise and we’ll kill you. </i></p>
<p><i>You’ll marry Jarl Thorkellson and keep your </i></p>
<p><i>mouth shut.”</i></p>
<p><i>A girl’s voice answers in angry reply, “My </i></p>
<p><i>father raised no weaklings. I’ll not be bullied </i></p>
<p><i>into betraying my clan.”</i></p>
<p><i>“More’s the pity for you then. Thorkellson </i></p>
<p><i>will have his way with you and slit your throat. </i></p>
<p><i>Then  he’ll  take  your  broken  body  back  to </i></p>
<p><i>Trundheim with the sad tale of how we tried </i></p>
<p><i>to rescue you, but with your last words you </i></p>
<p><i>pledged your love and legacy to Thorkellson.”</i></p>
<p>The trolls laugh heartily and then grow quiet, </p>
<p>feasting on hot broth and mead. It’s the perfect </p>
<p>time for the heroes to strike. Five raiders are in </p>
<p>the cave with their war gear nearby. A Notice roll </p>
<p>also  spots  false  “troll  feet”  made  from  various </p>
<p>hides lying in a pile near the fire.</p>
<p>The group should be able to strike with surprise </p>
<p>against the raiders. Unfortunately, the round after </p>
<p>the fight begins, Jarl Thorkellson and his personal </p>
<p>guard show up to the rendezvous and attack from </p>
<p>behind.</p>

<p>The.Salvage.of.the.USS.Kaine</p>
<p>The <i> USS  Kaine</i>  drifts  in  the  cold  reaches  of </p>
<p>space.  The  crew  of  the  salvage  vessel <i> USS </i></p>
<p><i>Clark </i> discovers  the <i> Kaine</i>  and  ventures  out  to </p>
<p>discover its dark secret.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Setting Rules:</b> Critical Failure, Gritty Damage</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Characters:</b> The  heroes are members  of  a </p>
<p>rescue vessel, the <i>USS Clark</i>. One of them must </p>
<p>be the captain and have Piloting and Knowledge </p>
<p>(Astronavigation) at d8 or higher. All of the crew </p>
<p>members must have Repair at d4 or higher.</p>
<p>The.USS.Kaine</p>
<p>The <i> USS  Kaine</i>  is  a  deep-space  probe </p>
<p>designed by the United States Navy to investigate </p>
<p>anomalies—including  signs  of  alien  life.  It  was </p>
<p>reported  missing  after  a  dangerous  mission  to </p>
<p>investigate Black Hole C1263. The ship was to </p>
<p>approach within scanning distance of the black </p>
<p>hole and take detailed readings on some unusual </p>
<p>energy signals detected there.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the <i>Kaine</i> got too close. It wasn’t </p>
<p>sucked  in—that  would  have  destroyed  it—but </p>
<p>gravitational distortions warped the crew’s mind, </p>
<p>reducing them to blood-crazed lunatics.</p>
<p>The.USS.Clark</p>
<p>The <i>Clark’s</i> computer picked up the <i>Kaine’s</i> faint </p>
<p>distress signal eight hours ago and the captain </p>
<p>set course immediately. The vessel is still located </p>
<p>near  Black  Hole  C1263,  but  not  dangerously </p>
<p>so. The <i>Clark</i> will arrive within 10 minutes—just </p>
<p>enough  time  to  allow  the  group  to  make  any </p>
<p>preparations they want.</p>
<p>Their vessel is equipped with tools of all sorts, </p>
<p>deep space suits with 10 minutes of continuous </p>
<p>propulsion  and  four  hours  of  oxygen,  and  any </p>
<p>other necessities they might think of. The crew </p>
<p>does  not  have  weapons,  but  the  captain  has </p>
<p>a  pistol  and  a  box  of  20  ceramic  bullets  in  his </p>
<p>cabin  if  he  wants  it  (Range  24/48/96,  Damage </p>
<p>2d6-2, Shots 7, will not puncture most inorganic </p>
<p>materials—such as the ship’s hull!)</p>
<p>The thick suits add +1 Toughness due to their </p>
<p>thick  material. A  hero  who  suffers  a  wound  or </p>
<p>more from a cutting or piercing attack must repair </p>
<p>the suit before heading out of life support or he </p>
<p>decompresses and dies in 2d6 rounds.</p>
<p>The.Approach</p>
<p>The <i>USS Kaine</i> is largely intact, though some of </p>
<p>the extending structures have all warped strangely </p>
<p>toward the bow (an effect of the black hole). There </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--173</p>
<p>Adventures</p>
<p>is  no  obvious  damage  other  than  the  warped </p>
<p>superstructure. Scans of the ship show there is </p>
<p>still residual power and life support functioning.</p>
<p>Docking  with  the <i> Kaine</i>  requires  a  standard </p>
<p>Piloting roll. A critical failure means the airlock is </p>
<p>jammed and the salvagers have to go EV (extra-</p>
<p>vehicular—meaning they move around outside the </p>
<p>vessels) to enter from the airlock on the opposite </p>
<p>side. This uses two minutes of propulsion for each </p>
<p>spacesuit.</p>
<p>Life.Support.&amp;.Gravity</p>
<p>Life  support  is  functioning,  but  the  artificial </p>
<p>gravity generator was overloaded in the surge. </p>
<p>The scavengers wear electromagnetic boots that </p>
<p>allow  them  to  walk  normally  (including  on  the </p>
<p>walls and ceilings!), but cuts their Pace by half </p>
<p>and inflicts a –2 penalty to all physical actions.</p>
<p>Should a character turn off the electromagnets </p>
<p>in  his  boots,  he  drifts  in  whatever  direction  he </p>
<p>moved last. Initial Pace while drifting is equal to </p>
<p>whatever it was last round, but a scavenger may </p>
<p>increase or decrease his Pace by 1 or 2 per round </p>
<p>by using their suit’s microthrusters.</p>
<p>Maneuvering  at  a  Pace  of  6  or  less  requires </p>
<p>no roll. At Pace 7 or higher, the hero must make </p>
<p>an Agility roll to turn sharp corners, get through </p>
<p>hatchways, make a melee attack, etc. If failed at </p>
<p>a Pace of less than 10, the character suffers a </p>
<p>Fatigue level from Bumps and Bruises. At a Pace </p>
<p>of 11 or higher, he suffers 1d6 damage for every </p>
<p>5” of Pace (round normally).</p>
<p>The  crew  of  the <i> Kaine</i>  does  not  suffer  any </p>
<p>penalties due to the absence of gravity. They’re </p>
<p>quite  mad  and  have  adjusted  by  now,  so  they </p>
<p>move effortlessly through the ship, scampering </p>
<p>along  the  walls  and  ceilings  like  some  sort  of </p>
<p>insectoids.</p>
<p>Should the scavengers succeed in repairing the </p>
<p><i>Kaine’s </i>artificial gravity, however, the situation is </p>
<p>reversed. and the deranged crew suffers a –2 to </p>
<p>all their physical actions!</p>

<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Bridge:</b> The <i>Kaine’s</i> navigational equipment </p>
<p>needs  extensive  repairs  before  she  can  be </p>
<p>piloted. Each Repair attempt takes an entire day </p>
<p>and is made at –2 (in addition to any penalties </p>
<p>for zero-g). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Captain’s Cabin:</b> A once neatly maintained </p>
<p>cabin, it is now a cluttered mess as a variety of </p>
<p>old  maritime  antiques  and  curios  float  through </p>
<p>the room.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Crew Quarters:</b> Each cabin is a reflection of </p>
<p>the former occupant. Some are orderly and clean </p>
<p>while others are in varying degrees of disarray. </p>
<p>Nothing of note is to be found in any of the rooms.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Engineering:</b> The engineering section takes </p>
<p>up two levels, with a balcony overlooking much </p>
<p>of  the  main  deck  portion.  The  ship’s  drive  is </p>
<p>functional,  but  the  artificial  gravity  generator  is </p>
<p>temporarily overloaded. Ten minutes labor and a </p>
<p>Repair roll (–2) can bring it back online.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Galley:</b>  Lightweight  tables  and  chairs  float </p>
<p>throughout  the  room,  along  with  the  body </p>
<p>of  another  of  the <i> Kaine’s</i>  crew. A  Healing  or </p>
<p>Knowledge  (Medicine)  roll  easily  identifies  the </p>
<p>cause of death as multiple stab wounds. If the </p>
<p>team searches the galley, a Notice roll uncovers </p>
<p>a butcher knife (Str+d4).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Laboratories:</b>  The <i> Kaine</i>  contained  three </p>
<p>state-of-the-art  laboratories.  With  a  successful </p>
<p>Notice  roll,  the  team  members  can  find  one </p>
<p>small improvised weapon in each lab if they are </p>
<p>specifically looking for them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Ship’s Stores:</b> A variety of standard equipment </p>
<p>is kept in these rooms, including spare space suits </p>
<p>and repair gear, but little is of immediate use. A </p>
<p>Notice  roll  spots  a  pneumatic  bolt  gun  (Range </p>
<p>6/12/24, Damage 2d6, Shots 6) which can be fired </p>
<p>using Shooting or Repair.</p>
<p>Something’s.Amiss</p>
<p>Regardless  of  how  the  salvagers  proceed </p>
<p>in  investigating  the <i> Kaine, </i> they  encounter  a </p>
<p>corpse in the third compartment they enter after </p>
<p>boarding the ship. The body floats, limbs askew, </p>
<p>twirling slowly in the absence of gravity. A mist of </p>
<p>blood globules seems to almost orbit around it. A </p>
<p>successful Healing or Knowledge (Medicine) roll </p>
<p>determines the cause of death to be blood loss </p>
<p>from numerous cuts, tears, and even bites. </p>
<p>Ambush</p>
<p>Immediately after leaving the room where they </p>
<p>discover the body, the team is attacked by a band </p>
<p>of three of the former crew of the <i>Kaine.</i> If possible, </p>
<p>the lunatics attack in a passageway, coming at the </p>
<p>party from both sides as they scuttle along the </p>
<p>walls and ceilings. They have no weapons other </p>
<p>than their teeth, hands, and feet.</p>
<p>Marooned!</p>
<p>Moments after the ambush begins, four other </p>
<p>members  of  the <i> Kaine’s</i>  crew  rush  the  airlock </p>
<p>to  the <i> Clark. </i> Any  characters  at  the  airlock  are </p>
<p>attacked. If there is no one there, the madmen </p>
<p>rush  into  the  airlock  and  manually  release  the </p>
<p>docking tube. The airlock protects the integrity of </p>
<p>both vessels’ atmosphere, but the decompression </p>
<p>of the tube blows the vessels apart.</p>

<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p>The.Fires.of.Ascalon</p>
<p>The ravaging hordes are coming and a party </p>
<p>of  elven  scouts  must  deny  them  sustenance. </p>
<p>The  town  of Ascalon  lies  in  the  way  and  must </p>
<p>be burned to the ground—if the villagers can be </p>
<p>convinced.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Setting Rules:</b> None.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>►</p>
<p><b>Characters:</b>  The  heroes  are  all  elves  or </p>
<p>friends of the elves fighting in a terrible war against </p>
<p>a savage foe.</p>
<p>The premise of this Savage Tale is that there is </p>
<p>a massive war in a typical fantasy world of elves, </p>
<p>dwarves, men, and orcs. The party is assumed </p>
<p>to be made exclusively of elves, who in this world </p>
<p>are viewed as aloof at best or outsiders at worst </p>
<p>by human society.</p>
<p>The  adventure  can  be  altered  to  fit  other </p>
<p>settings—including  those  without  elves  and </p>
<p>humans. The important circumstance is that the </p>
<p>player character’s party is made up primarily of a </p>
<p>race or nationality the villagers of Ascalon won’t </p>
<p>trust easily.</p>
<p>The  orcs  may  be  any  force  of  chaos  and </p>
<p>destruction—the  only  thing  that  matters  is  that </p>
<p>allowing the village’s precious resources to fall into </p>
<p>the horde’s hands would cause devastation for the </p>
<p>locals and hardship for the rest of the kingdom.</p>
<p>The.Mission</p>
<p>The heroes are scouts of the elves tasked with </p>
<p>an important mission. While the main force harries </p>
<p>the  orcish  horde,  the  adventurers  are  sent  to </p>
<p>burn the village of Ascalon. This was a decision </p>
<p>reached by the allied war council, which includes </p>
<p>humans, but the elves were closest and so were </p>
<p>appointed with the destruction of the village.</p>
<p>Read  or  paraphrase  the  following  from  their </p>
<p>commander when you’re ready to begin:</p>
<p><i>The horde approaches more rapidly than </i></p>
<p><i>anyone had believed. But all armies march </i></p>
<p><i>on their stomachs. I will lead our main force </i></p>
<p><i>in a bitter defense against the orcs at Gallows </i></p>
<p><i>Woods. Your mission will be to race to the </i></p>
<p><i>human village of Ascalon and...I’m afraid...</i></p>
<p><i>burn it to the ground. </i></p>
<p><i>Ascalon has rich farmlands and abundant </i></p>
<p><i>crops that will feed the orcs and prolong their </i></p>
<p><i>rampage for months. Even the wood from the </i></p>
<p><i>houses and inns must be destroyed lest it </i></p>
<p><i>be turned into weapons or siege equipment.</i></p>
<p><i>The horde has approached too quickly. The </i></p>
<p><i>villagers have not been told of this decision </i></p>
<p><i>by our allied war council and will likely have </i></p>
<p><i>to  be  forcibly  removed.  Convince  them  to </i></p>
<p><i>leave and do not harm them—but Ascalon </i></p>
<p><i>must burn. You leave immediately.</i></p>
<p>Unless one of the team has remained on the </p>
<p><i>Clark,</i> the only way the salvagers can get back </p>
<p>to their vessel is through an extended EVA. This </p>
<p>requires  a  successful Agility  or  Smarts  roll  to </p>
<p>navigate  the  gap.  On  a  failure,  the  spacefarer </p>
<p>expends two minutes of propulsion and requires </p>
<p>another attempt. On a critical failure, it uses five </p>
<p>minutes. Once a hero is out of fuel, he drifts into </p>
<p>the void unless rescued.</p>
<p>Last.Stand</p>
<p>The <i>Kaine’s</i> captain, Bill Weir, and the remaining </p>
<p>five  of  his  crew  have  laired  in  the  engineering </p>
<p>section. One floats limply through the main deck </p>
<p>pretending to be dead while the others hide in </p>
<p>the shadows of the balcony. If a team member </p>
<p>approaches the “dead” man, he suddenly comes </p>
<p>to life and attacks. The hapless victim must make </p>
<p>a Fear check unless she specifically states she is </p>
<p>expecting a trick. Regardless, the salvagers must </p>
<p>check for surprise.</p>
<p>The  captain  and  crew  attack  the  next  round, </p>
<p>diving from above. Treat this as a Wild Attack (see </p>
<p>page 87). The lunatics fight to the death.</p>
<p>Two of the crewmen on the balcony are armed </p>
<p>with butcher knives from the galley (Str+d4). Use </p>
<p>the <i>Kaine</i>  crewman stats for  Captain  Weir, but </p>
<p>treat him as a Wild Card. He is also armed with a </p>
<p>bolt gun, as above.</p>

<p>Adventures</p>
<p>The heroes are given torches covered in pitch </p>
<p>and  two  flasks  of  quick-burning  oil  to  get  the </p>
<p>largest  buildings  burning  as  fast  as  possible. </p>
<p>Ascalon is an hour’s run away and no horses can </p>
<p>be spared, so they must get moving immediately.</p>
<p>The  run  is  long  and  tiring.  Have  each  scout </p>
<p>make a Vigor roll or suffer Fatigue before they </p>
<p>reach Ascalon. Those with the Fleet-Footed Edge </p>
<p>add +2. This Fatigue can be recovered after 30 </p>

<p>The road to Ascalon from the elven camp winds </p>
<p>through green, scrub-covered foothills. Halfway </p>
<p>along the trek, have the group make Notice rolls. </p>
<p>Those  who  make  it  hear  sounds  of  fighting  on </p>
<p>the path ahead and can gain surprise on the first </p>
<p>round if they so choose.</p>
<p>The scene they see before them is an overturned </p>
<p>cart laden with fruits, vegetables, and flour. Two </p>
<p>horses  struggle  to  free  themselves  from  the </p>
<p>twisted  yokes,  and  three  farmers  are  doing </p>
<p>their  best  to  fend  off  three  circling  orcs  riding </p>
<p>mangy boars. The orcs are foraging for the main </p>
<p>horde and chased the cart for several hundred </p>
<p>yards  before  the  driver  took  a  sharp  turn  and </p>
<p>unfortunately overturned the wagon.</p>
<p>•	</p>
<p><b>Orcs  (3):</b>  The  orcs  ride  boars.  Use  the </p>
<p>statistics  at  the  end  of  this  adventure. The </p>
<p>raiders have Riding at d6.</p>
<p>Assuming the orcs are slain or driven off, the </p>
<p>humans  thank  their  rescuers  and  say  that  the </p>
<p>supplies were a gift to the war council from the </p>
<p>town. The leader of this small group is Nathan </p>
<p>Crenshaw,  a  strong,  soft-spoken  man  of  about </p>
<p>50. If the elves tell Crenshaw their plan, he and </p>
<p>his  boys  begin  to  right  the  wagon  (it  takes  10 </p>
<p>minutes). Then he heads back to Ascalon to warn </p>
<p>the elders and take part in any debate. If the elves </p>
<p>don’t mention their task, he heads on to the allied </p>
<p>war camp none the wiser.</p>
<p>The.Elders</p>
<p>In Ascalon, adults seem alarmed as they spy the </p>
<p>mysterious elves brazenly enter their town, while </p>
<p>the children gather in delight at their strange and </p>
<p>wondrous visitors. If the elves look for someone of </p>
<p>authority, they are pointed to Elder Elias Stosham, </p>
<p>the leader of this village.</p>
<p>Convincing Stosham of the elves’ mission is an </p>
<p>extremely difficult task. To do so, use the Social </p>
<p>Conflict system on page 110. The outsiders roll </p>
<p>at –4 unless Crenshaw accompanied them back </p>
<p>from  the  ambush.  If  so,  his  testimony  that  the </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>--Page--176</p>
<p>Savage.Worlds</p>
<p>elves  saved  him  and  his  companions  reduces </p>
<p>the penalty to –2.</p>
<p>If the heroes tie or lose the conflict, the villagers </p>
<p>turn  hostile  and  attack  unless  the  elves  seem </p>
<p>willing to leave.</p>
<p>If the elves win the debate by 1 or 2 successes, </p>
<p>Stosham orders the villagers to comply with the </p>
<p>elves’ “demands.” The villagers slowly gather their </p>
<p>loved ones and belongings and fade off into the </p>
<p>countryside.</p>
<p>If  the  heroes  succeed  by  three  successes </p>
<p>or  more,  the  villagers  gather  their  belongings </p>
<p>and  send  the  women,  children,  and  elderly  to </p>
<p>destinations further behind the lines. The men, </p>
<p>however, join the allied army, hoping to defeat the </p>
<p>orcs before any more villages must be sacrificed.</p>

<p>Whether they are defeated or reluctantly agree </p>
<p>to the plan, the villagers disperse, and no matter </p>
<p>how convincing the elves were, they will not help </p>
<p>burn their town. The moment the heroes begin to </p>
<p>set the fires themselves, a raiding party of orcs </p>
<p>arrives.</p>
<p>There  are  four  points  that  must  be  lit  to </p>
<p>effectively raze the town: the Rampant Lion Inn, </p>
<p>the granary silo, the bridge, and the livery. The </p>
<p>livery still has 2d6 horses and mules in it, so the </p>
<p>heroes will need to decide if they want to take </p>
<p>the time to evacuate them first. A loud yell and </p>
<p>successful Intimidation roll gets 1d4 animals per </p>
<p>round, a raise doubles that. Anyone with Animal </p>
<p>Companion or Beast Bond adds +2 to the roll. </p>
<p>The <i>beast friend</i> power can also be used on the </p>
<p>“lead” horse in the livery. All of the other animals </p>
<p>follow the round thereafter.</p>
<p>Setting  fire  to  these  four  areas  ensures  the </p>
<p>town and its supplies are denied to the rampaging </p>
<p>greenskins. A hero can set one of the objectives </p>
<p>on fire as long as he starts his turn in contact with </p>
<p>it, has a lit torch and oil flask, isn’t Shaken, and </p>
<p>makes a successful Smarts roll. A failed Smarts </p>

<p>to set the building truly ablaze.</p>

<p>In.Media.Res</p>
<p>At  the  end  of <i> The  Moscow  Connection,</i>  the </p>
<p>group stopped Mahmoud Abbas and a cell of the </p>
<p>Red Hand, and took possession of a mysterious </p>
<p>cargo loaded in the back of a large panel truck. </p>
<p>What’s the cargo? That’s up to you, the Game </p>
<p>Master,  but  it  must  be  big  enough  to  require </p>
<p>moving with the panel truck. The cargo might be </p>
<p>a nuclear bomb, or a dirty bomb, or something </p>
<p>far more bizarre—such as debris from the 1908 </p>
<p>Tunguska  Blast,  or  an  artifact  from  Chernobyl </p>
<p>(since it came in on a ship called the <i>Chernobyl </i></p>
<p><i>Revenge)</i>.  Or  maybe  it’s  a  strange  device  the </p>
<p>gangsters don’t even understand.</p>
<p>Regardless  of  the  nature  of  the  cargo,  the </p>
<p>Russians need to get it out of the area to one of </p>
<p>their own warehouses fast. Reinforcements of the </p>
<p>Red Hand are already on their way and a chase </p>
<p>through the streets of New York City are on.</p>
<p>Choose.Your.Poison</p>
<p>Start the action as one of the Russians (Ivan if </p>
<p>you’re using the pregenerated characters as he </p>
<p>speaks Farsi) hear reinforcements state they’re </p>
<p>“almost there” on one of the dead terrorists’ radios.</p>
<p>Then  give  the  players  exactly  one  minute  to </p>
<p>discuss  which  vehicles  they  want  to  take,  and </p>
<p>who’s driving or riding in each. They have to take </p>
<p>the truck since it holds the cargo, and Mahmoud </p>
<p>Abbas’ motorcycle still idles around the corner. </p>

<p>This  entire  adventure  is  a  Chase.  Tell  the </p>
<p>group  that  their  goal  is  to  get  the  cargo  away </p>
<p>from the Red Hand, and there’s no telling how </p>
<p>many  reinforcements  are  swarming  in.  Even  if </p>
<p>they defeat the first wave, more may come. If the </p>
<p>Russians are defeated, the mysterious cargo will </p>
<p>fall right back into their enemies’ hands.</p>
<p>This is an Extended Chase of 10 rounds. See </p>
<p>page  94  for  details  on  running  Chases.  The </p>
<p>heroes’  goal  is  to  escape  with  the  panel  truck </p>
<p>and its cargo intact. If the truck and the heroes </p>
<p>are still moving after 10 rounds, they lose their </p>
<p>pursuers and escape. If the truck is stopped, see </p>
<p>“Last Stand,” below.</p>
<p>The enemy is composed of fanatical members </p>
<p>of  the  Red  Hand,  riding  in  two  cars  and  six </p>
<p>motorcycles.</p>

<p>The  motorcycles  have  one  driver  each. The </p>
<p>cars  have  a  driver,  who  does  not  attack,  and </p>
<p>three  passengers,  two  of  which  can  attack  on </p>

<p>Remember  that  when  the  terrorists  have </p>

<p>attack a particular target at once as the various </p>
<p>vehicles weave in and out of traffic.</p>
<p>Complications</p>
<p>The inevitable Complications represent traffic, </p>
<p>construction  work,  or  blind  alleys.  In  addition, </p>
<p>if a red Ace is drawn and used by either of the </p>
<p>groups, it means the police have been drawn to </p>
<p>the pursuit. There’s a single police cruiser after </p>
<p>the first round the Ace is used. After that, roll a </p>

<p><b> 10-11 </b></p>
<p><b>Friendly:</b> The target will go out of his way </p>
<p>for the hero. He’ll likely do easy tasks </p>

<p>do more dangerous tasks for fair pay or </p>

<p>The issue is unsettled and no action is </p>
<p>taken until new and more compelling </p>
<p>evidence can be presented to reopen </p>
<p>the  negotiation.  In  a  court  case,  the </p>

<p>The target is reasonably convinced. He </p>
<p>grants  the  help  requested,  more  or </p>
<p>less, but may have conditions or ask </p>
<p>favors  in  return.  In  a  court  case,  the </p>

<p>the defendant is cleared of all charges.</p>

<p>The  target  is  sure  of  his  decision.  He </p>

<p><b>Roll Over:</b> The vehicle performs a Slip and rolls over 1d6 times in that direction. Roll </p>

<p>or accessories are ruined.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>3–4</b> </p>
<p><b>Spin:</b> Move the vehicle 1d6” in the direction of the maneuver, or 1d6” away from a damaging </p>
<p>blow. Roll a d12, read it like a clock facing, and point the vehicle in that direction. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>5-9</b> </p>
<p><b>Skid:</b> Move the vehicle 1d4” left or right (in the direction of a failed maneuver, or away </p>
<p>from a damaging attack).</p>

<p>a damaging attack).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>12</b> </p>
<p><b>Flip: </b>The vehicle flips end over end 1d4 times. Move it forward that many increments of </p>
<p>its own length. Roll collision damage for the vehicle, its passengers, and anything it hits. </p>
<p>Slow and heavy vehicles such as tanks (GM’s discretion) don’t flip but suffer a Slip or </p>

<p><b>2d6 </b></p>
<p><b>Effect</b></p>

<p><b>Scratch and Dent:</b> The attack merely scratches the paint. There’s no permanent damage.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>3</b> </p>
<p><b>Engine:</b> The engine is hit. Oil leaks, pistons misfire, etc. Acceleration is halved (round </p>
<p>down). This does not affect deceleration, however.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>4</b> </p>
<p><b>Locomotion:</b> The wheels, tracks, or whatever have been hit. Halve the vehicle’s Top Speed </p>
<p>immediately. If the vehicle is pulled by animals, the shot hits one of them instead.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>5</b> </p>
<p><b>Controls:</b> The control system is hit. Until a Repair roll is made, the vehicle can only perform </p>
<p>turns to one side (1–3 left, 4–6 right). This may prohibit certain maneuvers as well.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>6–8</b> </p>
<p><b>Chassis:</b> The vehicle suffers a hit in the body with no special effects.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>9–10</b> </p>
<p><b>Crew:</b> A random crew member is hit. The damage from the attack is rerolled. If the character </p>
<p>is inside the vehicle, subtract the vehicle’s Armor from the damage. Damage caused by </p>
<p>an explosion affects all passengers in the vehicle.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>11</b> </p>
<p><b>Weapon:</b> A random weapon on the side of the vehicle that was hit is destroyed and may </p>
<p>no longer be used. If there is no weapon, this is a Chassis hit instead.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>12</b> </p>
